<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a time of magic. The divine spark of the New Year resides in the days carved into this Season of Change. The pagans looked to the start of the Solstice, as the Sun reaches its lowest mark on the eastern and western horizons, to signal the start of a celestial shift learned long ago. But the Sun does not instantly begin to climb again as it reaches its low ebb. For three days, in an annual ritual, the Lord of Light counts cadence, before beginning to climb once again towards the east. The third day, in turn, is marked by Christians. For the rest of this month, the light begins to lengthen and the cold strengthen.</P>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like the pagan festivals that preceded it, Christmas celebrates the triumph of light over darkness, promising hope in the midst of despair. In the same way, the Christmas feasting represents one long splurge of luxurious eating, meant to sustain us through the last bitter lap of winter, the Lent of deprivation for which we are rewarded with rebirth and the springtime of Easter."</P>

 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Visions of Sugarplums, Mimi Sheraton</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This birth of the Sun, or child, is a tradition with many roots. We mark 'years' by our spiritual traditions as civilization looks back to its beginnings. As the infant Sun is born, it's Capricorn, and baby, it's cold outside. These are tough conditions for any birth. Time begins again with the New Year. The old man with the sickle is transformed into a new babe in a '2000' sash. They all represent rebirth.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Full Moon in Cancer on the Solstice (this year) emphasized the feasting for which the season is famous. But the Full Moon following the Solstice is always in Cancer. Domestic issues take on a greater strength, with the cold helping to shut down outside activities. We're forced indoors, with the celebrations bringing together family and friends. This is the holiday of the heat of the hearth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And it is often the memory of the fragrance of these meals which can take us back  across the years, anchoring our recollections of the various choices which were available in abundance. Food has a tradition all its own at this season, especially sweets. There's the yeasty coffee breads golden with saffron and mace, the fruit cakes, aged and spiked, jeweled with bits of candied fruits. Buttery cookies, mince pies, plum cakes and puddings, flaming wine punches and soul warming wassails, marzipan candies and the very air seasoned with the scents of vanilla, peppermint, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But along with all the outer trappings of holiday fare, there is also a real magic that is recognized by those who honor this ingress. It is a time to look ahead to the coming year, to sow the seeds of promise. Take time, and organize it. Plan for the year to come. Make resolutions. Society leads with way with calendars, datebooks, and daily planners, commencing on January 1st. Through the holidays, we choreograph our steps together; with the Solstice, Christmas, and New Year's. Whatever your path, whatever your prayers, the actions you take at this time become models for the next twelve lunations. This concept of a day for a month or year was common in ancient traditions. It is an astrological tenet. The priests who guarded these sacred paths of time honored them because of the power held there. Their sacred rites have been passed down through the generations as rituals, by tradition, to you.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturn is government. Saturn is establishment. Saturn is Time. Rituals of Time are in abundance with the Sun moving into the sign that Saturn rules, Capricorn. As the Sun enters its lowest level on the horizon, we observe the Winter Solstice. As it exits this low point, we have Christmas. One week later, governments around the world observe and coordinate common calendars, watches, and time zones, marking the start of a New Year together.<BR>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The images of time can be imagined in a variety of ways. While some carved 'Mt Olympus' from the halls of heaven, others used a sacred tree to mark the shortest shadow of the year. The Norse called their Tree of Life; Yggdrasil. Their Anglo-Saxon cousins burned the Yule, or 'Wheel' Log on the Solstice. A turning points on the 'Wheel' of life.</P>
