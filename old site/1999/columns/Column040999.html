While the VE moved through Taurus, agricultural concerns were the mortar which bound society together. During Aries, warlords become the line of 'kings and priests' under which society is shaped, commencing, around 2,000 BC, with the Indo-European invasions, and concluding, in the century before Christ, with the Roman standing army of the Republic. Following Aries, the VE moved into Pisces, and there's a new spiritual covenant with heaven, as the fish takes on a preeminence. Christ makes his first two disciples fishers of men, he feeds the multitudes with the fish, pulls the fish from the sea to pay the tax, and walks on water (Pisces is a water sign). Over the years, we have spent weeks exploring all of these themes individually.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="269" height="200">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/TaurusthruPisces.jpg" ALT="TheAges-TaurusthruPisces" WIDTH="267" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Taurus, Aries, and Pisces</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But when each of these 'Ages' come to an end, there is a period of social disintegration, upheaval, and chaos. The pillars which have supported civilization crumble, and people suffer. These periods have often been referred to as the end of time or the end of the world. They are not, literally, the end of the world, but rather, the end of a period of cultural continuity. Since Christ, there has existed a line of popes from then until now, one example of the continuity of which we speak.</P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Testament was a product of the Age of Aries, just as the New Testament is a product of the onset of the Age of Pisces. Spirituality is looked at in different ways by Jews and Christians, yet each of these two works contain references to the 'time of the end.' In the Old Testament, or original Bible, this period looked ahead to the end of the current epoch, Aries. Daniel does this by describing a segment of ancient history in great detail.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Book of Daniel was completed in about 536 BC, and addresses issues which were still in the future. It runs through a series of dream visions, many of which are explained in the same work. These predictions basically fill chapters 7 through 12. The style, and many of the images that are being used, are later repeated and referenced both by Christ and the Book of Revelation.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chapter 7, Daniel has a dream in which he sees four great beasts emerge from the sea. The first of these are said to be the Babylonian Empire (the prevailing power at the time of the writing). The second and third are the Medes and Persians, successors to the Babylonians. Finally, a fourth  beast, described by Daniel as different from the other three, crushes and tramples underfoot 'what remained.' This was said to be Alexander, who overthrew the Persian Empire inb 333 BC.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapters 10 through 12 go into considerable length to describe what is now thought to be the conflicts between the successors to the Seleucid and Ptolemaic Empires, products of the conquests of Alexander. These take us down to the end of Antiochus Epiphanes (175-165 BC), and the 'time of the End,' a period of 'great distress, unparalleled since nations first came into existence'. This is precisely when Aries is coming to a conclusion, getting ready for the advent of Pisces, and a new relationship with both heaven, and civilization. </P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="550" height="412">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/FourBeasts.jpg" ALT="FourBeastsofDaniel" WIDTH="548" HEIGHT="410"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Four Beasts,<BR> emerging from out of the sea</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Daniel's Dream: The Four Beasts</H4></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions that passed through his head as he lay in bed. He wrote the dream down, and this is how the narrative began: Daniel said, "I have been seeing visions in the night. I saw that the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea; four great beasts emerged from the sea, each different from the other. The first was like a lion with eagle's wings; and as I looked its wings were torn off, and it was lifted from the ground and set standing on its feet like a man; and it was given a human heart.  The second beast I saw was different, like a bear, raised up on one of its sides, with three ribs in ins mouth, between its teeth. 'Up!' came the command. 'Eat quantities of flesh!' After this I looked, and saw another beast, like a leopard, and with four birds' wings on its flanks; it had four heads, and power was given to it. Next I saw another vision in the visions of the nights: I saw a fourth beast, fearful, terrifying, very strong; it had great iron teeth, and it ate, crushed and trampled underfoot what remained . </P>            </TD></TR></TABLE><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
