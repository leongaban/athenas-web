<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few weeks,  we've been examining Neptune inconjuncting Jupiter in the US chart in 1836-1837.  We're interested in this alignment because next year, history repeats. Neptune has a cycle of 164 years,  and in 2000 it recurs. We will deal with similar themes, grafted onto current events.  Our job will be to see if we can determine the historical parallels ahead of time. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We've seen that on the date of our initial alignment, the Battle of San Jacinto took place,  now a national Texan holiday. In one swift act, a huge territorial chunk of Mexico was ripped from its breast under dubious circumstances. There never was any doubt about its outcome, only its morality. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We also saw the stage being set for massive Indian land takeovers. General Andrew Jackson broke the back of the Creek martial spirit in the South, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. Thereafter, land claims and settlements opened up exponentially. With our aspect in 1836-1837,  it was mostly a matter of simply moving what was left of the Indian tribes out of the way and off the land. Jackson's battle with the Creeks had started something new; it granted some Indians individual ownership of land,  splitting Indian from Indian, breaking up communal holdings, and introducing the competitiveness of Western capitalism amongst indigenous peoples.It also lay the base for the cotton kingdoms, the slave plantations of the South. </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second, or retrograde pass of Neptune to Jupiter occurred on May 24, 1836. The day before, on May 23rd, the Treaty of New Enchota was proclaimed. In this treaty, a few representatives ceded all Cherokee lands to the US for $5,600,000 and 'free' transportation to the Indian Territory,  Oklahoma. The forced removal which followed using 'government transportation' claimed the lives of nearly one quarter of all those who attempted the trip- to sickness,  drought, heat, and exposure. Both history and Cherokee tradition has remembered this event as the 'Trail of Tears.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Creeks, for their part,  had refused to budge, but by 1836,  both state and federal officials decided that they must go. "By midwinter the interminable, stumbling procession of more than 15,000 Creeks stretched from border to border across Arkansas". </B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B> The argument for Indian removal was explained by Lewis Cass,  Secretary of War,  governor of the Michigan territory, minister to France, and presidential candidate. We must not regret, he said, "the progress of civilization and improvement, the triumph of industry and art, by which these regions have been reclaimed, and over which freedom,  religion,  and science are extending their sway." Freedom for whom? This is precisely what Neptune in Aquarius (the illusion of freedom) inconjuncting (leveraging) Jupiter in Cancer (abundant resources in the land) describes. Every time a treaty was signed,  ousting the Indians from one area to the next and promising them security, whites would move in, and the Indians would have to sign another treaty, giving up more land for security elsewhere. Our legal system was used time and time again to justify these treaties, only to break them once more. Perhaps this is why Lewis Cass was granted an honorary doctor of laws degree by Harvard in 1836, at the very height of the Indian removal. </B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson began raids into Florida,  arguing it was a sanctuary for escaped slaves and for marauding Indians.  Florida,  he said, was essential to the defense of the United States.  It was that classic modern preface to a war of conquest.  Thus began the Seminole War of 1818,  leading to the American acquisition of Florida.  It appears on classroom maps politely as "Florida Purchase,  1819"- but it came from Andrew Jackson's military campaign across the Florida border,  burning Seminole villages,  seizing Spanish forts,  until Spain was "persuaded" to sell.   He acted,  he said,  by the "immutable laws of self-defense. " </B><BR>


<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson then became governor of the Florida Territory.   He was able now to give good business advice to friends and relatives.  To a nephew,  he suggested holding on to property in Pensacola.  To a friend,  a surgeon-general in the army,  he suggested buying as many slaves as possible,  because the price would soon rise.<BR>
