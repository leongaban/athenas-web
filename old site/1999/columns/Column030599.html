Since one of the two significant dates for this year has now come and gone, it's time to review what was said, and determine how we did.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="300" height="199">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/USA-ProgSun.GIF" ALT="Chart of the USA with Progressed Sun for 1999" WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="401"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Chart of the USA<BR> with progressed Sun for 1999</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>          <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "In 1999, the US progressed Sun, at 24&deg; of Aquarius, will first inconjunct Mercury at 24&deg; Cancer on February 8th..."</P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; And just what did this first date, February 8th, 1999, foretell? Since this alignment has never happened before, we had to look to other similar combinations from which to draw clues.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1854, the progressed Ascendant crossed 24&deg; Aquarius, and in 1928, the progressed MC followed suit. In 1982, Mercury crossed over this position. In the first and last of these alignments, Congress was in an extreme state of agitation. In the former, the Southern contingent secured enough votes for the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, paving the way toward Civil War. In the latter, President Ronald Reagan thumbed his nose at both Congress and theSoviet Union. In 1940, we also had an alignment which played into our theme,as the progressed Sun inconjuncted Mercury from 24&deg; Sagittarius. In that year Congress and the President were again at odds, with Congress wanting to avoid a European confrontation, while the President went behind their backs to arm the Allies. All of this, while he decided to run for an unprecedented thirdterm.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of these instances, there were important decisions being made which greatly affected both our future, and the economy; but it's important to understand that they were decisions, or their extension; Acts of Legislation. In each case, what was being said, or what was projected upon the future was wrong in every respect. The Kansas-Nebraska Act did not determine the free of slave status of those territories for the future. Hoover did not bring 'four more years of prosperity'. FDR promised, in the elections of 1940, 'Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars', while Ronald Reagan pushed for millions of dollars for a Star Wars program, designed for a geographic entity which no longer even exists. All this is a very brief synopsis of events which we took weeks to review last summer, but which led the Web to state,</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dramatic actions at this time will not be taken. Rather it will either be rhetorical, or at most legislative measures, which will be the center of controversy."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  On February 9th, 1999, the Boston Globe headlined the preceding days' events in Congress.</P> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Prosecutors's final stand- Frustrated House managers press for president's ouster.</B></P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Washington - Facing imminent defeat, President Clinton's accusers yesterday made their last stand in the impeachment trial, clamoring in their closing arguments for the Senate to summon the "political courage" to defy overwhelming public opinion and oust Clinton from office."</P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The first act in the drama has now unfolded. Once again, Congress was in an extreme state of agitation at the end of an impeachment process. What the President is claiming, fundamentally, is a lie. The people have flocked to his banner, largely as a result of the state of the economy. The test of time has shown that these conditions will not hold up, and the President's ordeal may not be over.</P>            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="405" height="317">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/SenateDoor.jpg" ALT="Senate Door" WIDTH="403" HEIGHT="315" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Senate in a Closed Door Session</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Senate shuts doors, starts debate</H4></CENTER></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Washington - The Senate huddled behind closed doors yesterday to begin deliberating President Clinton's fate, as a leading Republican predicted the long-running impeachment drama could end by Friday with Clinton's "bipartisian acquittal."</P>            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
