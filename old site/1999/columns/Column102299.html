<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now stand on the edge of time, looking across the horizon to a new land, and a new beginning. Our journey has brought us here. While wisdom and hope lead us forward, uncertainty is apparent, and the darkness from which we emerge continues to feed our fears. We are leaving behind the securities of the past for a questionable future. As we pause to rest our weary souls, our vision is obscured by the mists still lingering in the dawn of this new day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From our vantage point, it is evident that we are close, yet some of the most difficult terrain still lies ahead, together with some of our most frightening challenges. Yet, as we continue to navigate across these unfamiliar landscapes, guided by the stars, long dormant clues emerge from the stories and legends to help us find our way. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Long, long ago, in lands both near and far, there was a common thread which bound together the civilizations of the Earth in a way unbeknownst to modern researchers. As the Age of Taurus dawned some six thousand years ago, a new agricultural focus fostered an increased reverence for the fertility and life of the Earth. The world was nourished at the breast of our collective Mother, and together we gave thanks for it. The precessional Midheaven was then occupied by the constellation Aquarius. The hierarchies of the day turned to the stars for their calendars, their religious rituals, and their spiritual inspiration. It provided a backbone for many different civilizations, offering a framework within which efforts could be coordinated, and the gods placated. As each region looked to the stars for clues as to when to plant their crops, and how to travel across the uncharted wilderness, so they looked deeper into the mysteries of heaven, revealing the powers of the seven wanderers who traveled nightly across the skies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are obvious advantages to a feeling, localized, emotional, Earth-oriented family or tribal tradition (the Moon is in it's exaltation in Taurus, and therefore this was a time when lunar concerns not  only exceled, but were held in special reverence), one of its disadvantages was that everyone had a different story to tell. If there are twelve homes on a street, each one will have its own album of memories and traditions, joys and tragedies, which together weave the tapestry of their personal experience. This was especially true of this Age. Every tribe had its own localized origin myth, customized to fit the contours of the land. Egypt alone had at least three different origin myths, one of which described life arising from out of the flood waters and mud of the Nile. While in retrospect this may seem obvious, it makes for difficulties as these myths continue to flourish, grow, and begin to compete with other localized myths from other regions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet amongst this confusion was a common thread which rose above the dissimilarities, unifying not only localized cultures, but the entire planet. The constellation which hugged the North Celestial Pole, the single point visible to those living in the Northern Hemisphere at all times, was seen as a serpent which never set below the horizon; a flying serpent which watched over us all, protecting and guarding the secrets of time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Southwest, this was the Great Serpent of the Hopi.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When Native Americans call forth a blessing, they often turn to the four cardinal directions to open their invocations. Astrological tradition determines that these are, indeed, the critical coordinates of heaven. The seasonal ingresses, the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes, together with the Summer and Winter Solstices, mark the current Age and how civilization looks at life. During Taurus, depicted at right, the constellation of the Bull fell on the Vernal Equinox.  Scorpio fell on the Autumnal Equinox. At the same time, the Winter Solstice aligned with the constellation Aquarius.<BR>

																				&nbsp;&nbsp; During this agricultural epoch, the pharaoh/priests which organized this Empire turned to the stars (ruled by Aquarius) for their help in shaping society, planting by the heliacal rising of Sirius, or marking the holy days in their sacred calendars with an order monitored carefully by the religious right.</B>
