<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, we examined how various strands of US history contributed to the Panic of 1837, initiating a lengthy depression. A hyper-inflated economy, fed largely on the speculation involving western lands, collapsed in bank failures and many people's ruin. The poor had to struggle for basic necessities, such as flour, coal, and pork. In New York and other cities, there were protests and riots.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Celestial aspects produce terrestrial waves which manifest as  trends. In the years leading up to 1836 and 1837, the economy was growing by leaps and bounds, the future looked good, and the march of progress was in full swing. We have examined some of the streams leading into this period, with the resulting backlash which it generated. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The astrological alignment of 1836-1837 is about to repeat next year. The precise dates will include specific events which will unfold within the larger drama, helping us to understand the grand design. We will watch as March 20, June 28th, 2000, and January 17, 2001 provide us with clues. In addition, Neptune's pivots on May 8th and October 15th will also be times of importance in this divine plan. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the 1830s, the trends are already in place. Where is the US over extended? The most obvious example, of course, is in the stock market, with the financial gulf that exists between this nation and others in the world economy.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As Pluto conjuncted the US Ascendant in 1998, the strain on the economies of various nations was made apparent. Brazil, Japan, and Russia all began to falter. With Japan, the entire Far East felt the weight of the resulting sag in their economies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the market, high tech companies and the computer stocks seem the most vulnerable. While there may be incredible potential on the World Wide Web, individual companies representing the electronic highway are currently over blown.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the market, personal credit card debts have gotten out of hand for many people. There has been a recent wave of credit card availability, with many companies tripping over themselves to offer lower introductory rates to people of questionable financial means. As the economy begins to slow, this trend will end, and some credit card companies will call in their debts, much to the dismay of the purchasing public. With Jupiter in Cancer, we are also seeing, as a subset of this larger trend, a younger generation which has over committed themselves to their mortgages.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When Neptune inconjuncted Jupiter during its 1836-1837 pass, the country was involved in a wave of expansion that carried it just beyond our current boarders, claiming and clearing lands of their former inhabitants, for the social benefit of the young, expanding nation. During the current pass of Neptune in Aquarius, we are again involved in expansion, but this time on a global stage, and electronic connections fuse us together through cable, satellite, and microwave. Our current prosperity is part of a pyramidal system, with our nation poised atop the apex of the structure. Next year's alignments, particularly at the end of 2000, will be a start of the process of 'leveling the playing field' so that all may eventually benefit. But in the meantime, we will see the beginnings of a readjustment.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Web has just learned of a current issue that plays right into our predictions for the USA for 2000.  While doing some field research, it has come to our attention that events are now taking place in the Southwest which play right into the historical research we have been examining and relaying here in the Web.                                                 <BR>
																				&nbsp;&nbsp; We have spent quite a bit of time examining the human travesty which, in the name of 'prosperity and progress', we have ripped out the Native American's soul by uprooting them from their traditional ancestral lands and moved them out; usually into asimilar, and certainly less desirable, locations. The loss of life which historically accompanied these migrations were heralded in Congress as a ringing success.  From President Van Buren's address to Congress in December, 1838,                                                 <BR>
																				<BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Martin%20Van%20Buren">
&nbsp;&nbsp; "It affords sincere pleasure to apprise the Congress of the entire removal of the Cherokee Nation of Indians to their new homes west of the Mississippi. The measures authorized by Congress at its last session have had the happiest effect."                                                 <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

&nbsp;&nbsp; January 1, 2000 is currently the latest deadline in a series of efforts to move the Navajo Indians off their ancestral homelands in order that the fossil fuel resources in their lands might be exploited.                                                 <BR>
