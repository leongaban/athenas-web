In our April 2nd edition of the Web, we went into two of the principal ways in which heaven may be divided. One of these was the older, observational system, which used a familiar pole star and the Earth's equator as handy reference lines. But with the development of advanced mathematics by the Greeks, the more standardized ecliptic (path of the Sun), began to be increasingly used, based on mathematical computations rather than the more traditional observational techniques.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="301" height="226">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/AgeofPiscesGC.jpg" ALT="The Age of Pisces " WIDTH="299" HEIGHT="224"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Vernal Equinox <BR> at the beginning of the<BR> millennia</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal and autumnal equinoxes are the points of intersection between these two great circles; but they are common to both. How the intermediate space or time is divided can vary. Using our mathematical model the equation is relatively simple, and indeed, this is one of the beauties of the system. One simply divides the circle's 360 degrees into twelve. From this we derive the familiar twelve signs of the zodiac, each 30 degrees in length.</P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the observational system, the process is not so easy. Apparently, nobody told the stars that they had to fit into nice, neat divisions of 30 degrees, boxed in by logic and the eloquence of mathematical simplicity. Some constellations, like Pisces, are 45 degrees in length, while the stars of any two given constellations may simply overlap.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first star in the constellation Pisces triggered by the vernal equinox was Alpha Piscium in 392 BC. The final star in Aries was not triggered until 150 BC. This means that if we use the stars as our celestial benchmarks, there was an extended period of overlap. As the Age of Aries came to a conclusion, the Age of Pisces had already begun.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although most historians believe the precession was not discovered until Hipparchus, they nonetheless admit that he, too, was a 'convinced supporter of one of the leading doctrines of stellar religion'; in other words, astrology. Just as Pisces was to see 'water' as the element of spiritual medium, so the Age of Aries interpreted it as fire.</P><BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Pliny"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hipparchus," says Pliny, "will never receive all the praise he deserves, since no one has better established the relationship between man and the stars, or shown more clearly that our souls are particles of heavenly fire." </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an account of how Hipparchus (190-125? BC) experienced the 'End Times' in his homeland during his life.</P><BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Hipparchus"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invaded by the Parthians about the year 140 BC, recaptured by Antiochus VII of Syria in 130, reconquered soon afterwards by King Phraates, Mesopotamia was terribly ravaged for more than a quarter of a century. Babylon, sacked and burned in 125, never recovered her former splendor; a progressive decay brought on her a death by slow consumption. The new Iranian princes evinced no solicitude for the culture of Semitic priests. The vast brick-built temples, when the hand of the restorer was withdrawn, crumbled into dust, one by one were extinguished the lights of a civilization which extended backwards for forty centuries, and of the famous cities of Sumer and Accad there survived little but the name."</P></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can an Age indeed begin before another ends?  Of course it can.  Remember; this is myth, not math.</P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="264" height="201">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/TempleofHera.JPG" ALT="The Temple of Hera" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="199"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Temple of Hera</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>The End of a Tradition</H4></CENTER></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In architecture, literature, religion, and various other forms of culture, an Age was coming to an end. The classical tradition, like the ruins of her temples, saw a time that was passing, even as it gave birth to another- younger, stronger, and more vibrant. As Aries gave way to Pisces, society saw the shifting in moral emphasis from one of the empowered warrior; strong, noble, brave and true, to the thief, beggar and prostitute; those society had forgotten. There was a new message of hope, bringing the promise of peace and reward, not in this kingdom, but in the next.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is the power and longevity of an Age. It brings with it continuity and security. For as long as it lasts, each generation seeks to build on the traditions which have gone before. But as one Age ends and another begins, life enters a new voyage into unfamiliar waters, with uncertainty and confusion lying in the twilight mists of transition.</P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
