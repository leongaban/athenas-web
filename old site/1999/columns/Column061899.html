<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been examining events which took place 2,000 years ago. A tradition collapsed; another emerged to take it's place. This  didn't occur in a day or even a century, but occur it did- thoroughly, effectively, and completely, before it was over.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pagan pantheons around the Mediterranean were engulfed by the rising tide of Christianity. Later, other indigenous cultures around the world would follow suit. A way of living life had changed. Josephus reported that the prophesied new king would overthrow the Roman Empire, and in retrospect, he was right; just not as soon, or in the manner, envisioned. The Messiah's crucifixion was not the victory the prophets  had thought it would be, but Christ's sacrifice on the cross did conquer an earthly kingdom. It took three hundred years, but when Christianity finally assumed the reigns of power from the disintegrating Empire, it began a legacy which has rivaled ancient Egypt's in longevity. The image of Jesus, the fish, and the cross become the supreme icons of western civilization.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole point of this retrospective journey was to familiarize people with these traditions, and to understand how time ended, and was reborn. We again stand at the threshold of one of these earth shaking transitions. The generation that the Messiah called into creation is coming to an end. With it will come a new birth and fusion with spirituality. Our relationship with heaven, the Earth, and each other is in the process of being rewritten.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While we have clearly identified the changes between Aries and Pisces, what about now? What about the transition from Pisces to Aquarius? What has been the theme of the last two thousand years? How is this to shift into the Aquarian vibration?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Age of Pisces did not totally begin with the birth or crucifixion of Christ, so too, the Age of Aquarius has already begun in many ways. Pisces is an energy of introspection, of pondering the unknown, and merging with the depths of our inner being through contemplation, monasticism, and prayer. In the final centuries BC, mystery religions were gaining an extensive popularity. Christianity was only one of many. There was Mithraism, Isis, the Dionysian cults, and even worship of the Great Mother. Each of these had secretive rites which sought to look beyond the veil of life into the very essence of all being.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>As the vibration of the Age of Aquarius has grown stronger with its approach, we see knowledge and information slowly taking over from faith as society's preeminent focus. The Industrial Revolution, the Age of Reason, Science, Technology, computers and the Internet; these are all products of the incoming Age. Radio, television, satellites, rockets, jets, and even ultralights are all a part of the inventiveness of air. These represent some of the high side of this energy.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>But the material side of Aquarius has yet to fully integrate with its spiritual side, and this will represent a part of the true birth of this New Age. We begin to know, to inquire, to seek through the Freedom of Information Act and others, into the universality of knowledge and truth; spiritual waters given freely to all who are thirsty.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>We will return to this theme, but for next week, let's begin to focus on what the year 2000 will mean for the US of A.</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;We've dealt with the Ages before, but what exactly is an Age?  An Age is slightly over 21 centuries in length, as high as the sky and as deep as the political, social and religious influences of the times.  It's the chief celestial mold at work for any given length of time and its nature is often interpreted as the divine personality.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour hand which clocks its passage is the spring equinox; the time every year when day and night are equal.  It marks  a point on the ecliptic, the Sun's path through heaven, which moves backward through the constellations of the zodiac at an annual rate of 50.2 seconds of arc, traversing an entire constellation once about every 2,152 years.  Whenever this marker enters a new constellation it signals a radical shift in the world's self-perception.  Since recorded history began we've experienced its passage through only three constellations.  They are: Taurus, Aries, and now Pisces.  We approach the dawn of the Age of Aquarius, but it's not here yet.</B>
 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The elements of each of these signs have represented the spiritual medium for that Age. During Taurus, the Earth was held to be the sacred medium, and matriarchal societies had a greater reverence for the fertility of the Earth. During Aries, Fire was seen as being one with all life, as depicted by the Persians and Stoics. During Pisces, naturally, the waters of baptism became the new coin of the realm. Finally, in Aquarius, the winds will grow in influence and power, both in nature, and in the intellectual diversity which they represent.</B>
