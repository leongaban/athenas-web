There were two dates which stood out for the year. One of them has now occurred. February 8th, 1999 was the first of these, while the second is August 9th.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="301" height="236">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/BillClinton.JPG" ALT="Bill Clinton" WIDTH="299" HEIGHT="234"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>President William Jefferson Clinton</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be no question that February 8th was indeed significant in our history. After a long, exhausting, and expensive investigation by Independent Counsel Ken Starr, Congress picked up the Impeachment ball, and voted that there was indeed enough evidence to warrant a trial by the Senate. The Senate, with the House managers and Presidential lawyers, presented their case, and on February 8th, the prosecutors made their final bid, while the Senate then retired to debate behind closed doors. It had all come to this.</P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was predicted by the Web in &#146;92 that Clinton would not finish office, and the Impeachment proceedings brought that possibility closer to home than most thought possible. But the consequences of this verdict, in the opinion of this astrologer, have not yet been fully realized.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three strands of the Web which have been playing out in the sexual escapades of the President and his term of office. First, it was predicted that he would not finish office because the US Midheaven was Void of Course when he was elected. Second, Pluto passing over the US Ascendant brought sexual issues closer to the light of public consciousness than most could stomach through 1998. It made its two direct crossings over the US Ascendant as the information first broke in the media, and then as the House began their proceedings. Third, the two most significant progressed alignments for the US chart were what we examined in detail last year, and in each of our historical precedents, one was related to the other.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="99" height="77">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/anim_lewinsky.gif" ALT="Bill Clinton at work" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="62"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Clinton at work</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; What were some of the predictions which the Web made with regard to this event? First, that decisions made at this time will have dire consequences for the future. Second, the Executive Branch will be at odds with the Congress, the people, and the press. In this we were partially wrong. Certainly the Executive Branch was at odds with Congress, and that&#146;s the heart of the whole affair. The people, however, stood behind the President and were his greatest ally. Third, whatever is being said by the President, and possibly by Congress, will not come to pass as it is currently being portrayed. We&#146;ll come back to this one. Fourth, dramatic actions at this time will not be taken. Rather, it will either be rhetorical, or at the most legislative measures, which will be the center of controversy. Bingo! The House managers finished their entreaty on this day.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the end of the trial, additional allegations have come out about the President raping a woman twenty years ago; a contention that White House Spokesmen have, in a familiar pattern, denied. The people have stood by the President because times are good. The Web has also claimed that the fate of the President is tied up with that of the economy. If the economy goes South, so, too, will the President. Maybe back to Arkansas.</P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this may surprise a few, the Web continues to stand by its basic prediction. The President will not finish office. It ain&#146;t over &#146;til the lady sings.</P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P> </CENTER><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="481" height="269">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/jb.jpg" ALT="Juanita and Bill" WIDTH="479" HEIGHT="267"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Juanita and Bill</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Woman says Clinton raped her in 1978</H4></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Washington &#150; Juanita Broaddrick told her story to a national television audience last night, saying she didn&#146;t tell authorities 21 years ago of her contention that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her because &#147;I just don&#146;t think anyone would have believed me.&#148;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In an account punctuated by sobs, the Arkansas woman told &#147;Dateline NBC&#148; that in her Little Rock, Ark., hotel room, Clinton suddenly &#147;turned me around and started kissing me, and that was a real shock. I first pushed him away. I just told him no... He tries to kiss me again. He starts biting on my lip... And then he forced me down on the bed, I just was very frightened. I tried to get away from him. I told him no... He wouldn&#146;t listen.&#148;</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;NBC&#146;s decision to broadcast the January 20th interview after a month of heated internal debate dramatically boosts the visibility of Clinton&#146;s latest accuser. Had NBC aired the interview during the Senate impeachment trial and the furor over Monica S. Lewinsky, it might have had a significant impact on the political climate. </TT></P><CENTER>-by Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post, p.
