Neptune is once again in Aquarius, and will author a similar set of trends, many of which have already commenced.</P>          <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This combination of currents disseminates knowledge and information to the common people. In a nutshell, the masses are becoming better educated, are more interested in learning, equality and the improvement of social conditions. When the environment is conducive to these conditions, there's a spirit of teamwork and mutual cooperation. This was seen in the increase in communal activity which was apparent at that time. Intellectuals met for the exchange of perspectives, as with The Transcendental Club, featuring Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne and others, in a forum that went on for several years without any recognized officers, office, or schedule. On the flip side, however, when Aquarian themes are resisted, and social conditions are repressed to help further the interests of government, big business, or industry, then the revolution and rebellious side of this sign becomes apparent. These same years witnessed a period of increased strikes and social unrest, as people banded together to help improve their conditions, whether for the rights of children, women, slaves, or workers.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="299" height="374">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/HalleysComet.jpg" ALT="Halley's Comet" WIDTH="297" HEIGHT="372" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Halley's Comet</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Aquarius is also the stars. It's astronomy and astrology. During these years there was an increased interest in the signs of heaven. Late in 1835, Halley's Comet passed by the Earth on it's celestial sojourn. This was the pass under which Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born, better known as Mark Twain. He fully expected to die with the comet's return 76 years later, and did. Nevertheless, with this momentous event, both  people's imaginations, and their eyes, were turned towards the skies.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1840, an early astronomical observatory was constructed at Harvard by William Cranch Bond. In 1843, the Harvard Astronomical Observatory acquired, by private subscription, the largest telescope available. In March of that year, another comet appeared, visible in the daytime, arousing the public's interest again. The growing trend of giving lectures and public addresses by scientists was having it's hoped for effect, by stirring the public's perceptions and awareness. 1840 also claimed the first astronomical photography, as the Moon's image was captured by John William Draper, a physicist and astronomer at New York University. This was to set the precedent for America's world leadership in astronomical photography.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In October, 1847, Maria Mitchell, a Nantucket librarian and observer, discovered a comet, for which she received a gold medal from the King of Denmark. She was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the first woman to be so honored.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as one might expect with the planet of vision entering the sign of heaven, 1844 was the year Adventist William Miller predicted the second coming of Christ. Intuitively, this alignment anticipated the dawn of the Age of Aquarius, 168 years too soon, at which time the Messiah is supposed to return. It was the right vibration; but wrong century.</P>            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="291" height="347">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/TelOwl.GIF" ALT="Star Watching Owl" WIDTH="289" HEIGHT="345" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Why Owls Stay Up at Night</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Things are looking up!</H4></CENTER></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the interests of the multitudes begin to gravitate toward education, learning, and scientific endeavors, it was almost natural that their attention would turn towards the heavens. Astronomy has traditionally been held in high esteem, even bordering on the spiritual, having long been associated with the divine will. Truly, the mystique of the unknown is nowhere better represented. In the physical realm,  no other discipline is so vast, exclusive, or borders so demonstrably upon the infinite; not in the oceans, continents or even libraries of our land.</P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The level of academic expertise that's needed, in mathematical terms, to calculate and construct heavenly motion has long been a hurdle which has prevented all but an exclusive few into its inner circle. An understanding of logarithms and spherical trigonometry is essential, as are planetary formulas and multibody computations.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  During the years between 1834 and 1848, the heavens themselves seemed to 'light up' with activity. The growing inventiveness, along with new discoveries, pushed back the frontiers of science, and led to a new spirit of daring and adventure pioneered by academian and commoner alike.</P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
