The originality and inventiveness of this sign permeates through to the grass roots of society, such that the common people benefit from futuristic approaches to life. Education and freedom are fueled, as clubs, organizations, and volunteer efforts further their collective cause. Alternative philosophies abound; and science, knowledge, and mechanicalmarvels become the rage. From the spiritual side, the intuitive perception isthat all people are made of the same spiritual cloth, no matter the color ofthe particular swath.</P>          <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, these standardized themes are grafted onto the social conditions of the day, and the period we have been examining was more than 150 years ago. Things have changed. The industrial revolution was still in its infancy, with electricity, the telegraph, and motors just beginning to make an appearance. Liberty and freedom for all was an opinion increasingly heard in the newspapers and new magazines and periodicals, but it was set against a stage of women as a distant second class, immigrants as not much better than serfs, and slaves as property. Standardized texts were increasingly used as primers in a growing educational system (headed by Horace Mann in Massachusetts, an Aquarian state), and interest in astronomy was strong.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="300" height="226">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/ThinkDifferent.jpg" ALT="Different Drummer" WIDTH="298" HEIGHT="224" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Beat of a Different Drummer</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; These conditions are part of the parallels that we are now starting to see as a new social trend. Once again, there is a growing concern with education, as governmental focus channels money and resources in that direction. But more importantly, people are becoming more involved inalternative forms of education, from home schooling to computers in theclassrooms. And speaking of computers, the new textbook primer is the world'scentral nervous system- the World Wide Web. It is tying together and openingup a new awareness of our communities, a vast compilation of dictionary,directory, and encyclopedia whose authors are anyone with a desk top computer.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the world, peoples who have been denied their own ethnic identities are reclaiming their birthrights, as the Palestinians take their first faltering steps towards a new homeland, a new South African Congress arises from the ashes of apartheid, Eastern Europe throws off the yoke of Communism, and even Scotland begins to search for its identity from under anEnglish overlord.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these roots extend further back than simply the last year or two, but they represent the general trends towards national, social, and personal independence which will agitate for change and a radical shift from tradition and the status quo. It is an intermittent light, which flickers and then flares up, striking in riots and revolution when and where necessary, stirring up the disruption of change. These are a few of the themes which the collective judgement will see fit to advance over the next dozen years, but like any trend, they will begin to wind down and lose their edge as the energy matures, and then begins to wane. To all things there is a season, a time for each activity under the Sun. We now stand at the threshold of a new Neptunian pass through Aquarius, together with a New Age.</P>            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="422" height="236">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/StantonandMott.jpg" ALT="Stanton and Mott" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="234" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Elizabeth Stanton and Lucretia Mott</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Women's Rights</H4></CENTER></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott were forced tosit in silence at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840, they returnedhome and resolved to "form a society to advocate the rights of women." Whilepreparing for the meeting in Seneca Falls, NY in 1848, they drew up a list ofgrievances. Although some states had awarded control over their property,women had none over their earnings. They would model their Declaration ofSentiments on the Declaration of Independence.</P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  With Neptune again in Aquarius, women have begun to work once again for their rightful place in society, and are currently seeking through a national grass roots political campaign to elect a women president in the nextelection.</P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
