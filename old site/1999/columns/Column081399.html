This week, we look at the larger picture. How will the eclipse affect nations under its influence? Most aspects discharge their forces as the configuration becomes exact. Eclipses, however, have their own timing, setting up conditions which will occur in the future, long after August 11th has come and gone.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ptolemy, the first to record astrological principles, is the source to whom we turn. He claims that the 'ecliptical conjunctions of the Sun and Moon,' are the strongest influence for prediction. According to his outline, we should first look to those nations where the eclipse is 'fully visible'; especially to those countries whose charts respond to 18 &deg; of Leo, the degree where the eclipse occurs. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let us examine the total eclipse path. It started in the Atlantic Ocean, and first hit land over Cornwall, England. It then ran through France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and India before passing back out over the sea and into the sunset.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these nations, several have planets within the five  degree orb generally allotted to eclipses. France &nbsp;(Uranus at 15 &deg; Leo 24' in the 6th house)&nbsp, Germany &nbsp;(Pluto at 14 &deg; Leo 19' / 10th)&nbsp, Romania &nbsp;(Moon at 14 &deg; Leo 02', Pluto 14 &deg; Leo 32', and Saturn at 22 &deg; Leo 04' / 5th)&nbsp, Turkey &nbsp;(Neptune at 20 &deg; Leo 13' / 3rd)&nbsp, Iraq &nbsp;(Mercury at 14 &deg; Leo 49' / 1st)&nbsp, Iran &nbsp;(Moon at 14 &deg; Leo 35' / 3rd)&nbsp, and both Pakistan &nbsp;(Venus- 15 &deg; Leo 43' and Sun 21 &deg; Leo 08' / 4th)&nbsp; and India &nbsp;(Venus- 16 &deg; Leo 55' and Sun 22 &deg; Leo 04' / 4th)&nbsp have planets at these locations. Turkey comes closest to the exact eclipse degree. With Neptune in the 3rd house, we might expect her to seriously unload on her resident Kurdish population &nbsp;(the displaced homeless minority)&nbsp; just over the border, probably in the Spring of 2000. Tensions will grow between India and Pakistan, with the possibility of war strongest in June through August. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shadow of the partial eclipse, there are a number of strong alignments, each one with an individual interpretation. Mainland China &nbsp;(Saturn 17 Leo 39 / 7th)&nbsp; will run the risk of international condemnation in its handling of the Taiwan &nbsp;(Pluto 16 Leo 29 / 9th)&nbsp; issue, who will look in vain for international help next August. Nepal shows one of the tightest alignments to the exact degree, and may need to respond to events in China and/or India. Due to internal corruption at the executive level, Japan's economy will begin to feel the ill winds of the recession, as will Indonesia. Chad and the Sudan will experience a severe drought in the Spring. A complete list of countries with planets close to the eclipse position can be found at <A HREF="../../eclipse.html">Athena's Eclipse Info Link.</A></P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the Earth is concerned, it is this astrologer's opinion that we will see an increase in Sunspot (Leo) activity, together with continued weather pattern extremes which are tied in to the magnified solar flares. This eclipse is but one of several stepping stones leading us towards the New Age, together with all the letting go which that will entail. While the immediate result of an eclipse may be initially destructive, they can help us to better prepare for the incoming energies which are teaching us how to better live as a community.</P> </B><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"><P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="414" height="446">              <TR>                <TD>                                                 <!--Place Photo Here--><IMG SRC="../../img/EclipsePath.jpg" ALT="Path of the Eclipse through Europe" WIDTH="549" HEIGHT="228"><!-- To Here -->                 <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3> The eclipse first touches land in Cornwall, England,<BR> in the legendary land of Arthur.</H3></FONT><BR><A HREF="../../eclipse.html"><B>Athena's Eclipse Info Link</B></A><br></CENTER>                                 </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A> </B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
