<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next year, the US will experience a Neptunian inconjunct to our natal Jupiter. In order to understand the basic trends we will have to deal with, it makes sense to look back into history to the last time this alignment occurred, examining what we had to contend with at that time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Neptune represents the subconscious. It is what we do not see, know, or understand. Issues arising under Neptunian transits can produce confusion, illusion, and fantasy. Because it rules the water sign Pisces, there is often a wave of sadness that washes over the shores of our consciousness. Under its influence, there can be deep loss or bereavement that sweeps us away in its powerful undertow.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jupiter is the planet of expansion, morality, and philosophical beliefs. It's what we aspire to. Under hard aspects, it represents over extension, false morality, or committing outrageous acts in the name of God. It's foreign people and places. In the eighth house, it can indicate financial resources.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With Neptune in Aquarius inconjuncting Jupiter in Cancer in the eighth, we are faced with playing out fundamental differences with foreigners over financial issues. Problems which have been overlooked, ignored or denied over time are swept into the subconscious and buried there. During either Neptunian transits, or transits to Neptune's natal position, these issues are flushed to the fore where they are examined and reconciled.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The deceptions which occurred between the indigenous people and the white settlers were not limited to the years 1835-1838 when this aspect was exact, but they did crest at these times. Many of the coastal tribes who had originally greeted the white settlers had their populations decimated by disease (in many cases due to contact with European traders bringing diseases which the Native American had never developed antibodies for), white settlement, and warfare. There were powerful tribes west of the Appalachians who still had to be contended with. North of the Ohio were the Shawnee, Delaware and Miami, while the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Seminole lived further south of this river valley. Although the military power of these tribes had been broken during the War of 1812 (at the Battle of Thames near Detroit, and in March, 1814, at Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River in central Alabama), the years 1835-1838 represent the period when these people, obviously weaker and less numerous than the encroaching whites, were at the mercy of the federal government, and experienced a policy not far short of blatant genocide.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Numerous treaties made promises and offered protection, only to be promptly broken after obtaining their short term gains. In the US chart, Neptune conjuncts the Midheaven. We were a nation founded on religious principles, and have always felt our fate to be tied to a divine destiny. Unfortunately, Neptune squares Mars in the seventh house, which has too often manifested itself as a 'Might Makes Right' policy over indigenous peoples. We lash out at what we don't understand. The first federal treaty to recognize the Native American's right to the soil was called the Intercourse Act of 1790. In retrospect, it was an appropriate choice of terms. Today, we might paraphrase it somewhat differently.</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas it hath at this time become peculiarly necessary to warn the citizens of the United States against a violation of the treaties made at Hopewell, on the Keowee, on the 28th day of November, 1785, and on the 3d and 10th days of January, 1786, between the United States and the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw nations of Indians, and to enforce an act entitled "An act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes," copies of which treaties and act are hereunto annexed, I have therefore thought fit to require, and I do by these presents require, all officers of the United States, as well civil as military, and all other citizens and inhabitants thereof, to govern themselves according to the treaties and act aforesaid, as they will answer the contrary at their peril. </B><BR>
