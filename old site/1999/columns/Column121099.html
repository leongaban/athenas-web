<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In looking back to the end of the 6th millennium, BC, and speculating about what life may have been like, we are taking a rather large conceptual leap. It is one thing to talk about what the Babylonians or Egyptians felt about astrology. Various sources tell us these civilizations thought highly of heavenly influences. We know through their own writings; in cuneiform and hieroglyphic translations, and by what later peoples, like the Greeks, Romans, and others, had to say about them. These same measures, however, cannot be used for the cultures of the 5th and 6th millennia, BC. Only the archaeological record bears witness to the religious and social thought which may have existed in those earlier times, and it is more difficult to translate what these inert objects may have to tell us.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already observed in myths of various cultures a link between the constellation occupying the position of the North Celestial Pole (Draco) and the Vernal Equinox (in Taurus and Aries) from 4,000 BC until the end of the pagan era. We are left to wonder, however, whether this same pattern held for the <I>Age of Gemini: c.</I> 6456 to 4304 BC. Last week, we saw that the serpent image and its shorthand notation, the spiral, were dominant motifs in the art of Old Europe, building to a peak of unified symbolic and aesthetic expression around 5,000 BC. Do we also find numerous dualistic themes, inspired by the Vernal Equinox of that time, Gemini?</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the consistent representatives of Gemini are its dualism and elemental energy, Air. From the latter, it would seem that the power of birds as divine representatives of heaven (creatures of the air) should have been more emphasized. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have seen, these constellational themes combine with the serpent to give us a mythological picture of heaven's cornerstones of time; the crown of creation, the North Celestial Pole, and the mark of Spring, the Vernal Equinox.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If one then begins to mythologically mix and match these images, interesting correlations do, in fact, start to appear. Many natural couplings are found in the artwork of the times. Anthropomorphic figures with a single body and two heads are also portrayed. Two headed birds, as well as two headed serpents become familiar themes of this era.</P> 


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring is the agricultural start of the year. Creation is recrafted in the form of this new heavenly theme. Origin stories told of a huge egg, or double egg. This ascendancy flew high overhead, and conveyed the truths sent by the gods through the creatures of the air. The wisdom of the Egyptian falcon and ibis, and the Greek owl, eagle and dove were legacies originally born of this time.</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;These are precisely the archaeological images we find during this period. As in other epochs, once a tradition is established, its hold on the holidays is perpetuated long after the stellar corollary passes. Hence, the sacredness of the Bull in India, and the bullfights of Spain and Mexico are but distant memories which originated during Taurus. If we peer even further back, we can see echoes of the egg, remembered at Spring as the Easter Egg hunt. Eggs stand upright at the equinoxes, and together with the serpent, reunite our astronomical themes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this, in fact, the original impetus for all of the images we find here? We can only speculate.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The double-headed Bird Goddess at left is marked with a symbolic shorthand, chest-band chevrons consisting of three connected lines. The double headed goddess, pictured above, was found in Western Romania, and is dated c. 5000 or early fifth millennium, BC.  Although little is known of the true meanings behind these markings, certain motifs, like the spiral and its serpent association, seem to be apparent.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bird, Twins, and Snake Goddess predominate in the artistic representations found in Old Europe throughout this period. From <I>'The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, c. 7000 - 3500 BC,</I> by Marija Gimbutas, </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"The Snake Goddess and the Bird Goddess appear as separate figures and as a single divinity. Their functions are so intimately related that their separate treatment is impossible. She is one and she is two, sometimes snake, sometimes bird. She is the goddess of waters and air, assuming the shape of a snake, a crane, a goose, a duck, a diving bird."</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"The presence of the Bird and Snake Goddess is felt everywhere- on earth, in the skies and beyond the clouds, where primordial waters lie. Her abode is beyond the upper waters, <I>i.e.,</I>beyond meandrous labyrinths. She rules over the life-giving force of water, and her image is consequently associated with water containers."</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from its cosmological and astrological significance, there is one component of these water energies which we have not yet explored, and that is the climate of this period. Again, quoting from the above work,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"The desiccation of the climate during the sixth millennium BC is shown by palaeobotanical and geological research (clearly revealed by results of the author's own recent excavation an Anza, Macedonia) is also reflected in symbolic communication. The centuries-long lack of water resulted in the creation of symbolic images related to streams and mythical creatures considered to be the source of water."</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these images begin to make sense as to the cosmic relationship between the central axis of heaven guarded by the serpent, and the constellation marking the start of Spring, at that time a dualistic figure identified with the Air element. The Snake Goddess and the Bird Goddess: seperate figures and yet working in harmony together, ruling over both the waters, and the air. Divine representatives marking the cornerstones of time, and the beginnings of an advanced awareness of the motions of heaven, and the organization of time itself in an early form of the calendar. </P>
