<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The public's attention has been fixated lately on the Solar Eclipse which occurs Wednesday morning, August 11th, 1999. Not only is this a particularly dynamic event in astrological terms, but it is also highly probable that this was the celestial configuration which Nostradamus looked forward to in his quatrains, where he claimed,</P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <CENTER> "In the seventh month of 1999<BR>
A great king of Terror<BR>
comes from the sky<BR>
To receive the king of Angolmois<BR>
Before and after,<BR>
Mars reigns by good fortune." </CENTER></P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Nostradamus was using the Julian calendar, while we use a Gregorian, the disparity between the seventh and eighth month can be accounted for. Unlike most astrological alignments which we follow in the Web, eclipses are a predictive tool which set the stage for a later date. They do not crest with the astronomical geometry of the aspect, but rather set into motion events which will come to pass within four, eight, or even twelve months. As a result, the 'linkage' between eclipse and event is distant at best, and less obvious to the general public. This eclipse is part of a Grand Fixed Cross, and therefore more dynamic than most. Next week we will examine some of the implications for the world, but this week we will examine just what this means for us as individuals. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eclipses foreshadow darkness and destruction. It is like a rip or tear in time/space fabric. Powerful, chaotic forces are released; with some thinking of them as demons. Because this eclipse is part of a Grand Fixed Cross, it will be our essential, long term foundations that are fragmented.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, a Grand Cross means their are two sets of oppositions, each perpendicular to the other, with the Earth poised in the center. Saturn in Taurus is being opposed by Mars in Scorpio, while Uranus in Aquarius is opposite the eclipse in Leo (Sun and Moon). Each 'end' of the cross casts its own role in the drama, contributing to the larger design at work. The chief 'shaper' of social trends are the outer, slower moving planets. As a result, Saturn in Taurus squared by Uranus in Aquarius is one of the more formidable components in this alignment. Since Saturn is our structure, stability, and the status quo, while Uranus is revolution, rebellion, and change, we are suddenly having old, traditional issues being torn away from us. Change is disruptive. Within 24 hours of this exact alignment on July 17th, JFK Jr. unexpectedly went down in his plane, at sunset on the 16th. Suddenly our collective psyche was ripped open, and we lost what we had already thought was gone. Uranus squaring Saturn generates friction. Many people feel as though they have too much to do, in too little time. Our basic commitments- to our jobs, our goals, or even to each other- feel as though they've just been zapped by a cattle prod.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you add Mars in Scorpio to the mix, the entire brew becomes much spicier. Anger, envy, and revenge can enter the picture. Sexual misconduct, death, or debt can complicates our progress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hopis felt it important to conduct ceremonies and focus prayers at these times, to help offset the magnitude of the cosmic forces at work, and help supply an inner light in these times of darkness.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three different kinds of Grand Cross. They are the Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable Grand Cross. Each displays a different quality in it's manifestation.                                                 <BR>
																				&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cardinal Grand Cross is a configuration of action. Life, either in these people or at these times, is one of challenge. Many consider this the most powerful of the three alignments, and is designated by the more familiar cardinal points of the compass: North, South, East and West.                                                 <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fixed Grand Cross deals with long term patience, endurance and stability. These alignments represent the powerful pillars of society, whether in institutions, finance, or wellsprings of religious influence.                                                 <BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Mutable Grand Cross must learn flexibility amongst a sea of change. Adaptability amongst rapidly changing events keeps them going, accommodating different situations at different times.                                                 <BR>
	
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;        While the Grand Cross is an auspicious alignment in and of itself, when coupled with an eclipse, the potential for fundamental transformation is substantially magnified.                                                 <BR>																			</B>
