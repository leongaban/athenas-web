In the past, we noted in detail how Upper and Lower Egypt were unified as the Vernal Equinox passed between the horns of the constellation Taurus. Early Egyptians memorialized this motif as the Apis Bull with the golden orb of the Sun framed between his horns. The Sun is on thevernal equinox only on the first day of spring.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="549" height="271">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/HeadandShoulder.jpg" ALT="The Cut Between the Head and Shoulders of the Bull" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="269"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The 'Cut' Between Head and Shoulder <BR> Notice how the ecliptic passed between the 'Horns' of the Bull in earlier centuries </H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the Epic of Gilgamesh clearly states that the 'cut' must be made between the head and the shoulder of this same bull, marked in heaven by the Hyades and Pleiades, two groups of stars. The vernal equinox passed between these two markers between 2800 and 2200 BC. The Gate of Ishtar, originally constructed by Hammurabi during the 18th century BC continues the tradition by alternating images of Dragon and Bull, symbolically marking the center of heaven and vernal equinox of the Great Circle in artistic symmetry.</P> <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="302" height="193">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/BerlinDragon.jpg" ALT="Dragon on the Gate of Ishtar" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="191"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Dragon, guarding the <BR>North Celestial Pole of Heaven </H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; A thousand years later, Nebuchadnezzar rebuilt this temple, along with its original motifs, but the  ritual had changed. It shifted from Bull to Ram, noting the stellar shift from Taurus to Aries. In 600 BC, when the gate of Ishtar was rebuilt, the Vernal Equinox fell between the head and body of the Ram. In accordance with heaven's will, the Chaldeans obediently decapitated the head of a Ram at the altar as a part of a Spring time ritual.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; While following the trail of this highway, heaven has shown us much. From the Old Testament we learned the year of the original Exodus, while the New Testament provided clues to the interpretation of the Seven Seals. Myths from India, China, and the Americas contributed to our lengthy journey. It is all part of a grand, legendary drama, thought of at the time as the wisdom of antiquity. The Book of Revelation (the final book of the Bible), marked the start of a new generation, but it also culminated a period of thousands of years of metaphorical tradition. It is the most mythic book of the entire Bible, and it opens the door to events in the future. It's images, whiledescribing a new vision, ultimately spring from the older, familiar roots ofthe Tree of Life. It is a part of an ancient system with a consistent, albeitsymbolic, vocabulary.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now stand at the end. It is not simply the final year of the millennium, but rather, the final 13 years of a 2,152 year period. This is the time of the transition. According to the legends which long ago foresaw this period, we will witness changes such as the world has not seen since the time of Noah. Events will not wait another twelve years to unfold; indeed, theyhave already begun. The epoch from which we emerge has had its greatest powerin ignorance, denial, and suffering. It is a long story of man's inhumanity toman, woman, and child.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have identified the influence of specific stars as they crossed the Vernal Equinox. We have studied their impact on history. Revelation  claimed that the Alpha and the Omega were to be the beginning and the end. What's been missing is the key. Alpha Piscium was triggered by the Vernal Equinox over two thousand years ago. In 2013 AD, Omega Piscium will be triggered by the Vernal Equinox, identified in Revelation as the lamb (baby ram, zero degrees of Aries) of God. Stay tuned. </B></P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P> </CENTER><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="548" height="221">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/Revelation/AlphaOmegaI.jpg" ALT="The Alpha and the Omega" WIDTH="546" HEIGHT="219"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Alpha and the Omega</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><CENTER><H4>The Beginning and the End</H4></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways to divide the circle of heaven. The mathematical systems developed by the Greeks favored an equal division of the 360 degrees of the zodiac into 30 degrees segments. This is the method currently in vogue today. However, the observational systems originating in the temples of Eygpt, Mesopotamia, and India often used specific stars as benchmarks against which to measure the passage of time and space.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The constellation Pisces is a case in point. If one begins with Alpha Piscium and traverses the entire distance to the other end of the southern fish, a segment of heaven approximately 45 degrees in length is marked out. If, however, one begins with Alpha Piscium (an obvious selection as it is both the first and brightest star in the entire constellation), the distance to Omega Piscium is a much more regulated 31 degrees, more in accordance with our twelve thrity degree divisions to each of the signs.</P> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Each key is designed to fit a specific lock. The Book of Revelation is the key, the highway of heaven the lock. Written in the first century AD, it stood at the end of a tradition which had long followed the precessional path, as far back as we can historically and archaeologically perceive. In the century following the birth of the Messiah, this Book of John looks ahead, and offers its prediction as to what will happen in the future.</P>            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
