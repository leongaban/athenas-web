While there, we stopped at the Pergamon Museum, a rich repository of Greek, Roman, and Mesopotamian historical artifacts. Among the most impressive of these was the Gate of Ishtar, the ceremonial entry way into the palace of Nebuchadnezzar and his son. Like many ancient cultures, this ceremonial promenade looked to the New Year as its most important festival. This New Year did not pick, as we do now, the first of January, nor, as the Chinese do, the New Moon in Aquarius, for their inception date. Rather, it focused on the start of the agricultural year, the beginning of Spring, with the Sun's ritual passage into the sign Aries. </P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="255" height="334">              <TR>                <TD>                                 <IMG SRC="../../img/GermanAngel.GIF" ALT="German Angel" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="332"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>One of many angelic sculptures over Berlin</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may surprise Webheads to realize that the tradition of starting the New Year in the Spring is not as old, nor as distant, as it might seem. In England the New Year was celebrated on March 26th until 1712. Until 1556, it began on Easter for the French; while in Germany, the New Year did not move to January 1 until 1776. In the Middle East, many Arabic countries continue to celebrate their New Year based on the Vernal Equinox, and even the lunar calendar of the Hebrews mentions Passover, marking the flight of the Jews from Egypt, as the start of the New Year in Spring. Many cultures have felt that Spring is a natural birthtime for the year.</P>           <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gate of Ishtar was the stage around which the New Year festival was woven. In a familiar pattern, the Babylonian year also consisted of twelve months. It is a fundamental tenet of astrology that the starting point of any enterprise contains the secrets of its future. By determining the positions of the stars at birth, one may foresee the fate of an individual. An extension of this idea is the source of the ceremony of the Babylonian Creation Myth. Each year, the world is created anew, and the gods, or planets, hold the fate of the city in their 'hands' at that time. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="225" height="318">              <TR>                <TD>                                 <IMG SRC="../../img/GateofIshtar.GIF" ALT="Gate of Ishtar" WIDTH="223" HEIGHT="316"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Gate of Ishtar, with alternating Dragons and Bulls</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>  The festival was the ritual beginning of the New Year. It  was a pageant meant to curry favor with Marduk (Jupiter), the king of the gods. But each year, the king of the people must solicit this favor, which was never guaranteed. If there is any consistent theme from the auguries of the past, it was that the future was never certain; hence the intense efforts of governments everywhere to impress and win the good wishes of heaven.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ceremony lasted for eleven days, and although many of the details are lost, others have been pieced together from fragments. On the fourth day the priest invoked the constellation of the Ram (Aries), rising three and a half hours before sunrise, so that the stars might still be seen. In 600 BC, at the time of Nebuchadnezzar's New Year festival, the constellation and Vernal Equinox coincided with each other. On the fifth day of the festival, a solemn, yet bloody ritual, captured the celestial significance of the time. Asword bearer cut off the head of the Ram. This is an accurate reflection ofthe position of the vernal equinox, as marked by the RAMC, precisely at thattime. But as the year is born, so it is then consumed by its own mortality,and must be fated to perish. Centuries later, this same symbolism is reflectedin the Book of Revelation, in the image of the sacrificial lamb holding the'power'.</P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P> </CENTER><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="320" height="270">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/Aries600BC.jpg" ALT="VE in 600 BC" WIDTH="456" HEIGHT="221"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Vernal Equinox, <BR> circa 600 BC</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Sign of the Times</H4></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the constellational depiction above, when Nebuchadnezzar and his son, Nebuchadnezzar II, reigned during the height of the Chaldean Empire, the constellation Aries was being decapitated by the Right Ascension Midheaven, the perpendicular line which marked the Vernal Equinox in 600 BC. This constellation does not actually fall on the ecliptic, or path of the Sun. At this position in heaven, none does; but it comes closer than any other. Like many other contemporary myths and rituals, it gives an accuratedepiction of the sky during the period of history when the Babylonian NewYear's Festival was being celebrated, and is, in all probability, the sourceof the ritual.</P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
