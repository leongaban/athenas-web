<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the weave of the Web has developed a rather singular theme. We stand at the end of a period of civilization, a time in which we will witness the collapse of both the familiar, and the traditional. We continually look back into history to discover the patterns of time, and then graft those patterns upon the future for our 'predictions'.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the start of the year, we looked back to 1834 through 1848 to discover the themes that Neptune's passage through Aquarius revealed. From 1998 until 2011 these patterns are repeating, as the Lord of the Sea returns to the sign of the waterbearer. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Vernal Equinox this past spring, we began to take a look at the end of the Age of Aries, the epoch prior to the current one. We watched how Old Testament passages addressed the  'time of the end'. The Book of Daniel, written from the period of Jewish captivity, looked ahead several centuries and correctly predicted the social disintegration of the Roman Republic, along with the chaos that followed in its wake. As a part of this path, we were able to pinpoint the original star of Bethlehem, and therefore the season, and year, of the birth of Christ. During the Jupiter-Saturn alignments of 7 BC, Saturn did, indeed, go 'forward and halted over the place where the child was' (Matthew 2:10), beginning its retrograde motion right over the town of Bethlehem. That brought us up to June 25, when we paused to examine the USA's future for 2000.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our US investigation of next year's principal alignment brought us back to the height of the Indian Removal period in 1836-1837, and projected that history was once again about to repeat itself in the first year of the new millennium.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As one who has extensively studied the myths and legends of various cultures, I have found a repeating theme of a huge cataclysm which will occur at the end of the current cycle. Throughout 1997, we followed the trail of the Dragon around the world. While there, we learned of the Germanic myths and the final great battle of Ragnarok, wherein many gods and frost giants would die. The Mayans divided the 'Great Year' (one cycle of the precession of the equinoxes, or approximately 26,000 years) into five. Mayan 'Ages' are over 5,000 years in length (instead of our Ages of slightly over 2,000 years), and according to their tradition, one of these will end on the winter solstice, 2012. The myths of India also address a huge confrontation which will occur at the time of the end.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Christian mythology, the Book of Revelation describes  end times, when, </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Matthew11:18">
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>"... they should be judged, and you should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth."  -Rev. 11:18</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hopi are one of the last sacred holders of the spiritual flames of this land. Together with the Anasazi, their predecessors, they represent the oldest continuous culture in existence today. Their legends also speak of the end times, and of the natural destruction which will take place in the form of storms of great severity, earthquakes and floods which will befall humanity if their land  is taken. Make no mistake about it, although these lands lie far off in the Southwest, the impact of their predictions will become very local, indeed.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Athena's Web has been writing a weekly column in the Valley for sixteen years. For the first time during this endeavor, our editor has stated that we can no longer write about a specific topic. This week we had promised to look at some of the environmental impact that the strip mining was having on the Southwest. The coal fired electrical power plants located in the four corners region are one of the most concentrated sources of air pollution in the country. From these remote locations, electricity is channelled to distant cities, thereby importing their power, while exporting the pollution. The slurry mining system that Peabody uses to transport its coal is sucking the desert dry, as  the regional water table is substantially lowered. Residue from Uranium mines has been left behind on the reservations, leaving radioactive waste in the open.<BR>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This past week, the editor for the Amherst Bulletin of Athena's Web has flatly declared that she will no longer run any of the continuing coverage of the expulsion of the Dineh from the Hopi Partition Lands, contributing to the general media blackout of this issue around the country. If the Web submits further copy about this topic, it will simply be pulled, thereby helping to sentence, by silence, the Dineh to their fate.<BR>
