They are furthest from the Sun. They were used as one of many 'hour hands' to mark the passage of time by those who observed heavenly motion. In the Bible, it was first observed by astrologers.</P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturn and Jupiter form conjunctions every 20 years. For an extended period of time, they fall in signs of the same element. In one 200 year period,  from 225 to 7 BC, this conjunction occurred in water signs for ten out of twelve alignments. This is the sort of thing that catches astrologers' attention, and this one did. Interwoven in this watery imagery, there were several Saturn Jupiter conjunctions in the constellation Pisces, the sign of the (then) upcoming Astrological Age. It occurred in Pisces in 126, 66, and 7 BC, as well as 54 AD. The prophets had much to speculate about in how this combination might manifest. The rabbinic writer Abarbanel felt a new king (Saturn is the planet of worldly rulership) would appear for the Jews, a people ruled by Pisces.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn Jupiter conjunctions in Pisces were all the rage at the time. People were pondering both it, and the New Age, just as we ponder what Aquarius will bring. Obviously, it caught the attention of the three Magi. But does it follow that astrologers might have noted the position of a planet's station?</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The event we are examining occurred in 7 BC. A little more than one hundred years later, the first comprehensive work on astronomy, astrology, and geography was written by Claudius Ptolemy. His astronomical observations were made between 125 and 140 AD. For the next thousand years and beyond, the works by this author were to set the industry standard for both excellence and science. In a chapter on prediction, taken from a former work by Hipparchus, (190-126 BC), he claims eclipses to be the most auspicious, but then goes on to say,</P><BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Ptolemy"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "...the strongest and principal cause... exists in the ecliptical conjunctions of the Sun and Moon..."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "One part of the observations, required in forming predictions in cases of this nature, relates to the locality of the event, and <U>points out the cities</U> of countries liable to be influenced by particular eclipses, or by <U>occasional continued stations of certain planets</U>, which at times remain for a certain period in one situation. These planets are <U>Saturn</U>, Jupiter, and Mars; and <U>they furnish portentous indications, when they are stationary.</U>"</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on earlier work, Ptolemy was describing established Chaldean and Egyptian traditions, outlining  precise instructions on what to watch for. A Saturn station (pivot) occurring over Bethlehem, was as Ptolemy described. It was textbook astrological theory, as recorded by Matthew. Both astronomical and historical evidence suggest that the Saturn pivot of 7 BC is the one mentioned at the outset of the New Testament. Now, when was it?</P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P> </CENTER><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="240" height="322">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/JesusMangerSmall.JPG" ALT="Child in the Manger" WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="320"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>As the prophets foretold...</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>The Child in the Manger</H4></CENTER></P>            <BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Matthew2:2-3"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is he that is born King of the Jews?

They knew nothing about schools of astrology in the Holy City."</P> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Herod, the hated tyrant, was alarmed. The announcement of a new-born king brought his sovereignty into question. The people on the other hand were pleasurably startled, as appears from other historical sources. About a year after this conjunction of planets which has just been described, a strong Messianic movement came into being. Flavius Josephus, the Jewish historian, records that about this time a rumour went around that God had decided to bring the rule of the Roman foreigners to an end and that a sign from heaven had announced the coming of a Jewish king. Herod, who had been appointed by the Romans, was in fact not a Jew but an Idumaean."</P><CENTER><P>-The Bible as History, Werner Keller, p.330</P></CENTER><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rumor was correct, although the end of Roman rule would take centuries to accomplish.</P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
