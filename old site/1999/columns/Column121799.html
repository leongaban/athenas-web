<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under a cloudless sky on a cold winter night, the Full Moon commands a presence more powerful than at any other time of the year. Unlike the balance of the equinoxes, at the solstices the heavens are most 'tipped'. Because the Sun hardly makes it above the southern horizon, the Moon, at the opposite extreme, ascends to a dominance never attained during the summer, climbing high overhead. On this, the last Full Moon of the last year of the millennium, our glowing goddess of the night will watch at the gates of Winter as the Sun ascends through the narrow stone columns. She will reflect on all that has passed over the last thousand years, ponder what the future will bring, and stir the loyalties of tribal bonds the world over.</P>

<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first Full Moon to occur on the Winter Solstice in 133 years. It's also the day that the Moon is at perigee, its closest approach to Earth. That means that the Moon will seem bigger, climb higher, and be brighter overhead than at just about any other time. The Moon rules Cancer. This night is the reason why.</P>

 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Winter Solstice marks the seasonal start of the year. With the longest night, the Light will finally begin to return. When agricultural roots ran deep into the Earth, there was a reverence for the return of the symbol of warmth, hope and promise. It is an important intersection of two streams of time, the old year and the new coming together.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is any strength left in these ancient wheels, they should manifest in obvious ways as we cross over into the final solstice of the millennia. The prayers and actions undertaken during this pagan ritual will be as seeds sown for the future.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Full Moon, exact at 12:31 PM on Weds, Dec. 22nd, first reaches perigee at 5:44 AM, EST. It's about 14% brighter than when it is at apogee. The Earth is also several million miles closer to the Sun at the Solstice, adding yet another 7%.</P> 


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Astrologically, the Full Moon occurring on  the Solstice will heighten people's emotional reactions to life. Some embrace it more fully. The Moon also represents the inner light, and our inner eye looks back to the shades of yesteryear, experiencing a final emotional connection with our past before we commit them forever to the grave of a previous millennium. The Silver Lady is an emotional creature, one not given to logic. She obeys the passions of the current, with its high and low tides. As we gaze into the reflections of our souls, the unresolved issues which lie in the backwaters of our past reemerge. This will manifest on different levels for different people. For some, domestic issues will dominate, while others will be hard at work on their 'home' on a different level, as nationalistic sentiment (Cancer) challenges traditional authority (Capricorn).  Taken to an extreme, terrorists may make their  nationalistic and primal statements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Winter Solstice this year, waters will run deep. Family bonds will be tested. Those who have passed, during the year, century, and millennium, will be remembered. We will examine our social sins , looking back over history in an attempt to shed our ignorance and misdeeds from the past. The politicians, church, programmers and media have called attention to it for months; but beyond the social side, we will most of all feel it personally.</P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is as the male archetype of Thoth, the Egyptian scribe, pictured at left, or the feminine Diana, at right, the Moon has filled various roles in the pantheon of life.<BR>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dec.22, the power of the Full Moon will stand out as it rarely does, evoking our emotional response to life. Not only will it be bigger, brighter, and higher in the sky than usual, but we will feel the influence of this ancient goddess calling us from the paths of Olympus to do her bidding. Is it possible to resist the call? Of course! It's as easy as being able to rise above your own emotions.</P>
