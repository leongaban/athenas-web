<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year the Web examines the celestial blueprint of the US to see what's in store for our great nation for the coming year. One of the more powerful alignments next year will be Neptune in Aquarius inconjuncting the US Jupiter in Cancer. Over the next few weeks, we'll disassemble and discuss this aspect, when it will occur, and how it manifested historically. Neptune has a cycle of 164 years. In 2000, this blue gaseous giant at the other end of our solar system will return to the position it occupied over a century and a half ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Neptune in Aquarius deals with collective aspirations. It's what the American people do or don't believe in. Together, these two represent the dream of freedom, liberty, and independence. It's how folks relate to each other at a societal level. As Neptune in Aquarius inconjuncts Jupiter in Cancer, there's a tension which develops between these two archetypes. It causes problems, and flushes unresolved issues to the surface where they are dealt with for better or worse. These conditions can produce some of the finest writings, ideals, and aspirations of the time, but they may be  stimulated by the prevailing trends which stand in sharp relief to these lofty sentiments. It is a time when fundamental philosophies clash. It may indicate war.</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Neptune will first inconjunct Jupiter on March 20 and June 28, 2000, and for a final time on January 17, 2001.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Neptune last inconjuncted the US Jupiter five times in two years, on April 21, and May 24, 1836, and again on January 31, September 3, and November 29, 1837. What were some of the national themes at work at that time?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the first of these alignments became exact, tensions with Mexico were building to a head.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>On March 2, 1836, Texas declared itself an independent republic. This new political entity sent representatives to Washington, DC, where the US was unwilling to recognize the renegade, in part because it did not want another strong slave state brought into the Union.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Four days later, on March 6, 1836, the Alamo fell. It was a fortified mission garrisoned by 200 Texans. After crossing the Rio Grande, Santa Anna's three thousand troops killed everyone in the Alamo except for a mother, child, and servant.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>On April 21, 1836, just as our alignment formed its first exact aspect, the Battle of San Jacinto was fought, in which General Sam Houston defeated Santa Anna. With these battles, the Republic of Texas carved out its independence from Mexico.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Republic of Texas became part of the prevailing expansionistic policy of the US, which would come to be known as its 'Manifest Destiny'.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>In 1835, '36, and '37, the US was also attempting to ostracize the Seminoles from Florida, force the Cherokees to sign a pact to move to lands west of the Mississippi (which would become known as the Trail of Tears), and were relocating the Choctaws, Chicksaws, and Creeks from their homelands. As a nation, we were bending those weaker than us to our will. History has recorded the travesties, deceptions and legal slights of hand which were used in order to achieve our nationally sanctioned territorial ends. By victimizing indigenous peoples in the South, it was a time when the country lost its moral center.</B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As white settlers crossed into the fertile river valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers into the nation's interior, state and federal goverments continually wrestled away lands from indigeneous peoples; by outright purchase, through legal and illegeal enterprise, and by war.  By the 1830's, only the southeastern tribes still controlled significant portions of their traditional ancestral lands east of the Mississippi.</B><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"With Florida now belonging to the United States, Seminole territory was open to American land-grabbers. They moved down into north Florida from St Augustine to Pensacola, and down the fertile coastal strip. In 1832, the Treaty of Camp Moultrie was signed by a few Seminoles who got large personal landholding in north Florida and agreed that all the Seminoles would leave northern Florida and every coastal area and move into the interior. This meant withdrawing into the swamps of central Florida, where they could not grow food, where even wild game could not survive.</B>
 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The pressure to move west, out of Florida, mounted, and in 1834 Seminole leaders were assembled and the US Indian agent told them they must move west... (He) managed to get fifteen chiefs and subchiefs to sign a removal treaty, the US Senate promptly ratified it, and the War Department began making preparations for the migration. Violence between whites and Seminoles now erupted...</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>When (the US Indian agent) ordered the Seminoles, in December 1835, to assemble for the journey, no one came. Instead, the Seminoles began a series of guerrilla attacks on white coastal settlements, all along the Florida perimeter, striking in surprise and in succession from the interior.</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>General Winfield Scott took charge, but his columns of troops, marching impressively into Seminole territory, found no one. They became tired of the mud, the swamps, the heat, the sickness, the hunger... No one wanted to face the Seminoles in the Florida swamps. The war went on for years...</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>'The adaptation of the Seminole to his environment was to be matched only by the crane or the alligator.' It was an eight-year war. It cost $20 million and 1,500 American lives...</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>In 1837, Osceola (leader of the Seminoles), under a flag of truce, (was) seized and put in irons, then died in illness in prison."</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>"Eight hundred (Native American) Creek men had volunteered to help the United States army fight the Seminoles in Florida in return for a promise that their families could remain in Alabama, protected by the federal government until the men returned. The promise was not kept. The Creek families were attacked by land-hungry white marauders- robbed, driven from their homes, women raped." <BR>
