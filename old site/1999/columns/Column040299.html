That's the easy part. There are many ways that the relationship between Heaven and Earth, or Earth and sky, can be measured. </P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="176" height="370">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/atlas.gray.small.jpg" ALT="Atlas" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="368" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Atlas,<BR> holding up the heavens</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The different house systems of astrology illustrate the various ways in which heaven can be partitioned. Whether you use Placidus, Koch, or Campanus, or the Regiomontanus, Porphyry, or Equal house systems depends on whether you're dividing space, time, or distance, and precisely how you go about dividing it. </P> <P><B>In astronomy, we also run into this problem. Clock time, as we usually think of it, is measured from when the Sun is at high noon, to the next day as the Sun returns to this same position. Actually, we use midnight now instead of noon, but the principle is the same. But astronomers use sidereal time, which they feel to be a more accurate measure. Rather than using the Sun, they observe the motion of a more distant star, and watch to see when it returns to the same position in heaven. Because the Earth is so much closer to the Sun than to a star, there is a discrepancy between the two. The Earth has actually moved around the Sun in its yearly motion, which gives a four minute discrepancy between our 'Sun' or clock time, and the astronomer's sidereal or 'star' time. </P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Building on this same theme, the manner in which we have observed the heavens has changed over the course of time. Fundamentally, there are two great circles which grid the Earth and its sky. These are the ecliptic, or path of the Sun, and the Earth's equator. In both contemporary astrology and astronomy, the ecliptic is used as the line from which computations are based. It is from this circle that the aspects are derived. Cut the circle of 360&deg; in half, and you have an opposition (180&deg;). Cut the same circle in quarters, and we have a square (90&deg;), etc. Mathematical computations are much easier, given this solar orientation.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is not the framework of antiquity. Astrology and astronomy arose out of a system of observation. The temples of Stonehenge and Karnak (on the Nile) were the stone cradles from which our modern vanguard of science arose. This earth-oriented system used the horizon and a pole star to fix their observation points. The heavenly net which was used to measure the motions of distant stars and planets was based upon this mesh, rather than the more recent, mathematically based, ecliptic. In fact, these two could easily be thought of as an 'earth' and 'sky' system. Neither is right or wrong. They simply depend upon the vantage point. The 'earth' based system is still used today to construct our lines of longitude and latitude on the planet. Beginning at the pole, they make their way to the equator. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The point of this deliberation is that the legends of antiquity were based on the older, observational, earth-oriented, equatorial system. When we examine the myths of antiquity, attempting to fully unlock their secrets, it is to this system that we must turn. And it is this system that is about to align with the star, Omega Piscium, in spring of 2013; an alignment overlooked not only by the astronomers, but even by most astrologers of our day. </P><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"><BR><BR><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="549" height="190">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/SameSky.jpg" ALT="The Same Sky" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="188"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Same Date, Same Time, Same Sky</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>                         <P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="1">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="547"><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3>                        <P><CENTER><H3><B>The Same Sky</B></H3></CENTER></P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The gird system on the left uses the ecliptic, or the path of the Sun, as its base line, and all perpendiculars are calculated from this line. The gird system on the right uses the celestial equator as its base line. This is the older, observational system, and would be what the temples of antiquity used as a system of calibration for the heavens. All the perpendiculars eventually converge very close to what we today call the pole star, and the heavens appear to rotate around this common center.  This is why it is the observational system.  It is what we see from the Earth.<BR>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
