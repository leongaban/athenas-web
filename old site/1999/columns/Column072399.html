<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few weeks, we've been examining the trends leading into 1836-1837, because these were the years during which Neptune inconjuncted Jupiter in the US natal chart. Our rational for this investigation is because next year, in 2000-2001, this alignment reoccurs, triggering some of the same themes. The more we understand the patterns of the past, the better we will be able to anticipate the waves of the future. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first exact alignment of Neptune to the US Jupiter, the Battle of San Jacinto was fought, and the Republic of Texas established its independence from the newly formed country of Mexico. Within 24 hours of the second exact alignment, the Treaty of New Enchota was proclaimed. It was the legal vehicle by which the Cherokee nation relinquished all the lands owned by them east of the Mississippi River. Throughout these years, the Creeks were being removed from Alabama, the Choctaws from Mississippi, and the Chickasaws from Arkansas, Mississippi and West Tennessee. Only the Seminoles in Florida held out for a while by fighting a defensive war, striking quickly and then vanishing into their environment so well, that even Native Americans from other tribes had a hard time finding and ferreting them out. The seizure of all this land opened up the growing frontier to white colonization, and an unprecedented period of economic prosperity for the country. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; President Andrew Jackson represented much of the governmental will which backed this expansion. He sincerely wanted the people to benefit from this new landed prosperity which he leveraged for the country. But Jackson did not fully grasp the economic implications of so much speculation over too short a period. The availability of easy credit, combined with the promise of vast new opportunities for the ownership of land, towns, commerce and trade fueled the spirit of both enthusiasm and greed. When it was slowed by Jackson's Specie Circular on July 11, 1836 (there simply wasn't enough gold and silver available to keep funding the speculation), the result was the economic panic of 1837. It initiated a depression which lasted until 1843. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The panic was triggered on May 10, 1837 (on the day of the final retrograde pivot of Neptune in this series), when New York bands refused to make payments in gold or silver. During 1837 alone, 618 banks failed. Together with the depression came widespread unemployment, and the higher cost of basic commodities. There was a Flour Riot in NYC. Much of the work of the labor unions over the previous ten years was completely undone. Employers leveraged the workers by imposing longer hours, cut wage and piece rates. They divided workers, usually along ethnic lines, such that they turned their frustration and anger on each other.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the roots of these trends had taken years to build, the collapse landed squarely on the shoulders of Martin Van Buren, Jackson's hand picked successor. In fact, he came to be known as  'Martin Van Ruin', although he had only been in office for a few weeks when the panic hit. These extremes, born on the exploitation of those weaker and more vulnerable, ultimately were the fuel upon which the resulting depression fed. Unfortunately, once again, it fell on the weak and vulnerable. </B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin Van Buren was the first Chief Executive (1837-1841) born under the United States flag. By 1827 he had emerged as the principal northern leader for Andrew Jackson. President Jackson rewarded Van Buren by appointing him Secretary of State. As the Cabinet Members appointed at John C. Calhoun's recommendation began to demonstrate only secondary loyalty to Jackson, Van Buren emerged as the President's most trusted adviser. Jackson referred to him as, "a true man with no guile."                                                 <BR>
																				&nbsp;&nbsp; Van Buren devoted his Inaugural Address to a discourse upon the American experiment as an example to the rest of the world. The country was prosperous, but less than three months later the panic of 1837 punctured the prosperity.  Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of  &quot boom and bust, &quot was following its regular pattern, but Jackson's financial measures contributed to the crash. His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West. To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money, gold or silver.                                                 <BR>
																				&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1837 the panic began. Hundreds of banks and businesses failed. Thousands lost their lands. For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history.                                                 <BR>
