<P>
<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy Jackson was a speculator from the very beginning. He was a speculator in both land and slaves, and probably the most aggressive enemy of the Indians in the early history of this country. It was Andy Jackson who broke the Indian's will at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, opening up much of Alabama to white settlement. It was Andy Jackson who led raids into Florida, burning Indian villages and taking forts, so that the Spanish were coerced into the 'Florida Purchase' of 1819. And, it was Andy Jackson who opened the South to the slave plantations, helping 'King Cotton' rise to the pinnacle of its power in the antebellum South. </P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was with this singular eye and purpose that Andrew Jackson was able to ride his popular ticket into the white house, remaining there for a full three terms, from 1825-1837. Even his successor, Martin Van Buren, was hand picked by Jackson. It is little wonder, then, that this same vision would continue to inspire his presidency. Having opened up the new frontiers to settlement, exploitation and commercialization, Jackson was interested in seeing people gain from the fruits of his labors. The easy availability of money both through inflation and bank loans met with his approval. With all the new land leveraged from the Indians, Spain, and Mexico, there was a new source of viable wealth and future income for the nation; but there was still one man, and one institution, which stood in his way. </P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The man was Nicholas Biddle; the institution the United States Bank. Congress had given this national bank a twenty year charter in 1816, and it acted as the chief financial rudder of the country. Biddle represented the aristocratic, monied class, but his banking principles kept the regional banks in line. It prevented state banks from making unwise loans by insisting that they back their notes with specie (gold or silver coin), and by calling in its own loans to these institutions. The bank's central office was in Philadelphia, but together with its 29 branches, it performed many useful services, such as offering commercial loans, accepting federal deposits, and buying and selling government bonds. 
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bank had many enemies. Some state bankers, especially those in Baltimore and New York, were jealous of the huge financial power in Philadelphia. Some southern and western farmers regarded the bank, which dealt with paper rather than property, as immoral. Others thought it to be unconstitutional, favoring the rich. Businessmen and speculators in western lands resented the bank's careful control over state banking, and wanted cheap, inflated money. And there, at the vanguard of this last group, stood Andrew Jackson.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jackson took his battle with the bank as a personal affront. He once told Van Buren, "The bank... is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!" He therefore vetoed the extension of the bank's charter, and redistributed federal funds into state banks. This removal of the only real brake on the country's economy fueled speculation in land, but the inflation began to worry even the President. As a result, in 1836 Jackson issued the Specie Circular, which stated that speculation on western lands had to be backed by gold or silver. One year later, on May 10, 1837, banks started to call in their loans, initiating a depression which was to last until 1842. </B></P>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew Jackson had become president as a leader of the people.  One of the principal reasons for his reelection in 1832, was his determination to destroy the second Bank of the United States. </B><BR>


<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "After McCulloch v. Maryland had presumably established its legality, the Bank of the United States had flourished. Its president, Nicholas Biddle,  managed it brilliantly.  Almost alone in the United States, he realized that his institution could act as a rudimentary central bank, regulating the availability of credit throughout the nation by controlling the lending policies of the state banks.  Small banks, possessing limited amounts of god and silver, sometimes overextended themselves in making large amounts of bank notes available to borrowers in order to earn interest.  All this paper money was legally convertible into hard cash on demand, but in the ordinary run of business people  seldom bothered to convert their notes so long as they thought the issuing bank was sound.  Bank notes passed freely from hand to hand and from bank to bank in every section of the country."                                                 <BR>
