What we have learned is that technology took an amazing leap forward for society. Of the signs of the zodiac, the three air signs deal with communications.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="250" height="517">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/MissAquarius.gif" ALT="Aquawoman" WIDTH="248" HEIGHT="515"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Aquawoman</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>          <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gemini, the first of these air signs, deals with the development of personal communicative skills, speech and articulation, the training of the nervous system, writing and learning. </P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Libra, the second of the air signs, raises the singular development of Gemini, focused on their own personal skills, to interpersonal communication and cooperation. The scales have come to represent the courts and the legal system, wherein its idealized goal is that before the law, everyone is equal. This can mean individual vs. individual, corporation, or national government. Each carries equal weight in court. Marriage and divorce are the other areas which are most often placed in Libra's camp. Here, the one-on-one associations are obvious.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Aquarius, our final air sign, is concerned with collectivecommunication and what's best for the society. It, too, represents the nervoussystem and equality, but its concern is less personal or interpersonal, butrather of what's good for the majority. It is for this reason that we findeducation, and the diversity of everyone within society, coming into greaterfocus under the vibration of Aquarius.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the principal technologies which helped to enhance society's 'central nervous system' was the invention of the telegraph between 1834 and 1848. Communications for the country took a huge step forward at this time. Messages which heretofore had been delivered by horse, stagecoach, or clipper ship could now be carried instantaniously across the wires from station to station. This meant that news which had once arrived days or even weeks after the event, could now be transmitted in hours. It was during this period that this collective 'nervous system' was born, although it didn't developovernight.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel F. B. Morse demonstrated his new telegraph for a few friends in 1835. It was severely limited and inefficient because he was unfamiliar with advances made in electromagnetism by his contemporaries. Over the next two years he applied the results of more recent research, and improved the equipment. He applied for a patent in September, 1837, although it was notgranted until 1844. On May 24, 1844, with the Sun and Mercury in Geminitrining Saturn in Aquarius, and Mars also in Gemini trining Neptune inAquarius, the first telegraph message was sent from the US Supreme Court inWashington, DC to Alfred Vail in Baltimore, MD, by Morse. It read, "What hathGod wrought." Although the federal government appropriated the money for thisline, he was unable to interest them in the new technology, and the MagneticTelegraph Company was founded three years later on April 16th, 1847, by Morse.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the same way that the telegraph united us in a more instantanious fashion, so now the World Wide Web is helping humanity take another communicational leap, in another sweeping enhancement of our collectivenervous system, with it's text, audio, and video potential for the future.</P>            <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="347" height="295">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/AngelofProgress.jpg" ALT="The 'Angel' of Manifest Destiny" WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="293" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Triumph of Technology</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>The March of Progress</H4></CENTER></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This painting in 1872 by John Gast, with its large goddesslike figure divinely inspiring a trail of telegraph wire in her wake, was a significant theme of the march of progress being felt across America through the 19th century. Although this technology was in many ways born of the passage of Neptune through Aquarius from 1834 to 1848, its influence naturally did not end there. Decades later, as the country continued to expand, so, too, did the seeds which had been planted during these years.</P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Along with the heavenly lit goddess (notice the light descending on her from above), the horse, wagon, stagecoach and railroad engine all seem to drive the Indians and wildlife from their path, as the spirit of "Manifest Destiny" swept the nation under a tide of patriotic fervor.  It seemed God wanted this country to run from sea to shinning sea. Like the web of the central nervous system which runs through our bodies, coordinating themovement of hands and feet, so the telegraph lines were seen coordinating andquickening life within the country.</P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
