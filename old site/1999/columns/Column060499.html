One common misconception people have is the image of a sudden brilliant light, or a powerful radiance in the sky associated with the Star of Bethlehem. Quite simply, this is not what Matthew says, and is nowhere mentioned in the Bible. It seems that this brilliance has been grafted retroactively onto the Star, but is not documented by scripture. A Saturn Jupiter conjunction, even if exact, is not much more dynamic than Jupiter by itself. Saturn is often mistaken for one of the 'fixed' stars of heaven, if measured in terms of brilliance alone. It is because it is a 'wanderer' that it is distinctive. It moves against the backdrop of the constellations, but is not that 'big' as seen from Earth's sky. None but the magi (and not kings, by the way) seem to have noticed this Star.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We examined historical evidence that Saturn was thought to be linked to the Jews. Tacitus called it their 'God'. Astrological textbooks of the time taught their disciples to look for the precise stations of the planets, noting the specific cities over which they pivoted. We even have evidence that the Eastern astrological schools paid particular attention to the Jupiter Saturn conjunction of 7 BC.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1925, a German scholar by the name of P. Schnabel deciphered a number of Neo-Babylonian cuneiform 'papers' from a famous institution of the ancient world; the School of Astrology at Sippar in Babylonia. Quoting from 'The Bible as History',</P><BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Schnabel"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>&quot;Among endless series of prosaic dates of observations he (Schnabel) came across a note about the position of the planets in the constellation of Pisces. Jupiter and Saturn are carefully marked in over a period of five months. Reckoned in our calendar, the year was 7 B.C.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;p. 328 </B></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This represents substantial  historical evidence within astrological circles in the East. We have documented interest in this conjunction. At least three of the magi thought enough of heaven's signs to make the trip to the Jewish promised land to witness and pay homage to the new born king.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the series of three conjunctions between Saturn and Jupiter in 7 BC, there is only one time that a planet could have moved forward and then halted. This is the initial retrograde pivot. Both Saturn and Jupiter pivoted after their first conjunction, but only Saturn's pivot occurred over Israel/Palestine.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's curious that the celestial indicator which marked the inception of the Age of Pisces and the Christian Epoch, should be rediscovered in the final year before the millennium? This is good news, and bodes well for the future.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody should tell the Pope.</P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P> </CENTER><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="399" height="287">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/GkMatthew.JPG" ALT="Matthew in Greek" WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="285"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Greek Text of Matthew</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Eastern Star</H4></CENTER></P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="3"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'We have seen his star in the east'</B> (Matt. 2:2), said the Wise Men, according to the Authorized Version.
