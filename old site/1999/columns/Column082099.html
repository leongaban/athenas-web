In the first three weeks of this series, we focused on the human travesty of how Native lands were taken. Stolen would be a better word for it.  In the words of Howard Zinn,</P><BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Howard%20Zinn"><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "These treaties, these land grabs, laid the basis for the cotton kingdom, the slave plantation. Every time a treaty was signed, pushing the Creeks from one area to the next, promising them security there, whites would move into the new area and the Creeks would feel compelled to sign another treaty, giving up more land in return for security elsewhere."	People's History of the US, pp. 127-8. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having watched these cycles before, the next step seemed logical. If, during a previous pass, events played themselves out on a national level, it seemed likely that this time we would probably be dealing with international circles, especially given our current global status. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When Uranus squared the US Neptune in 1986, it was a repetition of the same alignment that had occurred in 1902-1903. At the start of the century, we extended the Monroe Doctrine, keeping European governments out of domestic policies in South America through a policing action. In 1987, Israel asked us to take on a new policing role with Libya in the Mediterranean, and we did. The Web foresaw and predicted these events in January of 1987.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In our predictions for next year, it seemed inconceivable, given the history of social injustice to the Native American, that this country would again be moving down that same path, with the international media focus, our history of championing civil rights, and most recently, NATO's  use of force to come to the aid of the Albanians in Kosovo. The days of ethnic and social injustice seemed to be at an end, with 'might' finally coming down on the side of 'right'. Unfortunately, history is preparing to repeat itself, and we are on track for another transgression of civil rights in this country. Just as the historical precedent suggested, our country is getting ready to strip Native Americans of their birthright, their homes, and their land.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dineh (Navajo) and Hopi are on a legislative countdown. If Congress does not move to stop these events (indeed, Congress is the one who has set them into motion), these people will once again be forced off their ancestral lands with the Peabody Mining Company  stripmining these lands to get at the coal reserves. But first, the people already living there must be moved off. Quoting from a letter recently received while investigating this subject,</P><BLOCKQUOTE CITE="Carol"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's amazing how few people know of what is still going on right here today in the US. The war on the Indians continues- it has never ended- and the Dineh of Black Mesa/Big Mountain are among the most threatened and abused victims of that war, which is also a war on the Earth by stripmines and coal mining that drains the irreplaceable water aquifer."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm glad you've found out about this ongoing ethnocide and 'ethnic cleansing' scheduled for its 'final solution' on February, 1, 2000."</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While holding up freedom and personal liberty for those an ocean away, we ignore our own.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven't we learned anything yet?</P> </B><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"><P><CENTER>                                  <!--Place Photo Here--><IMG SRC="../../img/DinehReservationAZ.jpg" ALT="Dineh Reservation, AZ" WIDTH="428" HEIGHT="481"><!-- To Here --> <P>                                <FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3> Black Mesa/Big Mountain is right in the center of the Dineh Reservations </H3></FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER><H3><B> Send to: Senate Select Committee On Indian Affairs</B></H3></CENTER></P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><H3>Copy this:</H3><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Senator Daniel Inouye, Vice Chairman,  (or Hatch- U, or McCain- AZ)                                                <BR>																				&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dineh and Hopi who live on Black Mesa, located in the state of Arizona, are being forcibly expelled from their land. Most recently, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has ended a two-year moratorium on livestock confiscation. The people of Black Mesa depend for their food and livelihood on their livestock. Removal of the animals will cause hardship and starvation. Both the relocation, and  imminent threat of livestock confiscation, are wrong and must be stopped.                                                <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Acts of Congress passed in 1974 and 1996 hasten the conclusion of the relocation process. These laws serve the interests of coal mining companies who wish to profit from the rich and accessible coal deposits of Black Mesa. These laws make it illegal for the people of Black Mesa to live on the land on which they were born. The fundamental rights of freedom, religion, and home are being stolen from the people of Black Mesa.                                                 <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;        As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, you are uniquely positioned to aid these people and halt the continuation of this tragedy.<P>And then go to <a href="http://www.magiccookie.com/activism/black-mesa/contacts.html">Black Mesa, contacts page</a> to send it along to Senator Inouye and/or your own reps.                                               <BR>																			</B></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A> </B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
