We have shown how the prophecies outlined by his dreams corresponded to the celestial epoch known as the Age of Aries, a period which drew to a conclusion during the first century BC. In each of these columns, we have claimed that the end of each age is a period of social disintegration, without describing exactly what that has meant in history. This week, we will outline some of the specific events of the last century before the birth of Christ, to better illustrate just how society began to collapse from within.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="457" height="222">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/Aries600BC.jpg" ALT="Aries" WIDTH="456" HEIGHT="221" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Vernal Equinox, moving through the Age of Aries</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it is important that we draw this distinction: the Age of Aries was an epoch  ruled by Mars. This archetype is thought to be the God of War, and this was, essentially, an Age of Warfare. If civilization as we understand it was born at this time, it was contrasted by the destruction and brute force which was apparent throughout the two thousand plus years during which the War Lord reigned. It is not war, per se, that marks the period of social deterioration during the end times, but rather, of society turning on itself and collapsing from within. Whether we consider the Indo-Europeans, Pharaohs of the New Kingdom, Hittites, Mycenaeans, Celts, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Greeks, or Romans, we are fundamentally looking at cultures who learned to live, and die, by the sword.</P> <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="197" height="273">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/JuliusCaesar.jpg" ALT="Julius Caesar" WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="271"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Julius Caesar</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the first century BC, the Roman Republic had conquered most of the Mediterranean. They had absorbed the Carthaginian trade empire of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Africa and Spain, as well as the Greek world and a portion of Asia Minor (modern Turkey). During this final century, under the leadership of Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Julius and Anthony Caesar, Gaul (modern France), and the East would also be brought under the Roman yoke; but these same leaders saw the seeds of social disintegration take root and flower, as Rome began an extended period of Civil War (all dates are BC).</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrest begins as slave revolts erupt from within the Republic (135-132, 104-100, and in 73-71, with Spartacus). The murder of Tiberius (133) and Gaius (121) Gracchus are a part of an early wave of civil disorder. In 100, Marius, the hero of the War with Jugurtha, puts down rioting in Rome. In 91, there is the outbreak of Social War, with Marius battling Sulla, his former subordinate. First Sulla (88), then Marius (87), takes over Rome, with the latter systematically putting to death the leading members of the Roman aristocracy, displaying their heads in the Forum. After the death of Marius, Sulla returns, and massacres the last of the Marian armies (82), but not before they had raided the religious temples of Rome for revenues. Following this, Sulla exercises reprisals against Romans that leave the Marian atrocities far behind. From 57-53, there is again rioting in Rome, and in 50, Caesar crosses the Rubicon, turning his own army on Rome. In 44, Caesar is assassinated. Brutus and Cassius are defeated at Philippi (42). Antony is defeated at Actium (31). Finally, in 27 BC, Octavian, now known as Augustus, establishes himself as Emperor and begins the Empire and the Golden Age of Rome, signaling  the bloody end to the Age of Aries, and leaving the Republic behind in ashes.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The epoch is established by the angel. The vision outlines the immediate future for the Middle East. Daniel lives during the time of the Chaldeans. The two kingdoms which follow are those of the Medes and the Persians (the Ram with its two horns). The latter was overthrown by Alexander (the original horn of the goat), who died at the height of his power, with his conquests divided into Macedonian, Seleucid, and Ptolemaic kingdoms, together with the original Greek homelands, making four smaller horns, or kingdoms, in all.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Daniel, addressing an epoch before the birth of Christ, and the current 'end of time' as referred to by the New Testament, both be correct? Because they each refer to the end of different astrological Ages. The former marked the end of the classical Age (Aries), while the latter marks the end of our current epoch of civilization. </P>                        <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="177" height="271">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/PompeytheGreat.jpg" ALT="PompeytheGreat" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="269"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Pompey the Great</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Going Down in Flames</H4></CENTER></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the Age of Aries, this fire sign had burned itself out. The aristocracy of the Classical tradition drew its membership from the patrician families of Rome, a nobility working together through the Senate. Their ranks were decimated during the wars and massacres of the final century, being replaced by a new business class. Even though both Republic (Age of Aries), and Empire (Age of Pisces) had a Senate, its backbone had been broken during the social unrest and upheaval of the first century BC, becoming not much more than a rubber stamp for the new emperors, lacking in its own vitality and will. The Pax Romana had come at a dear price, one in which the spirit of the nobility had been broken. While we have been examining Roman history in particular, this is a change which is taking place around the world at this time. The Age of Aries had produced the spirit of the individual looking for justice, art, and law (Aries-Libra), while the Age of Pisces was to produce a civilization of merchants subservient to the church (Pisces-Virgo). Our focus, over the last few weeks has been on the disintegration of one Age, as it melts down and blends into the new era. Ovid's contemporary work wonderfully captures the essence of this transition in its title, The Metamorphosis. </P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
