We have observed how western civilization realigned itself along new principles, as an entire epoch faded into the mists of history, and a new, more vigorous one emerged.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="213" height="375">              <TR>                <TD>                        		<IMG SRC="../../img/Justice.GIF" ALT="Justice"      WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="373" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Justice, balancing the <BR>Sword of Ares<BR> and<BR> Scales of Libra</H3></FONT>				</CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rush to individualism of the Age of Aries led to the obvious archetypal characteristics of the celestial science; the veneration of heroism, the glory of fame, and, in Stoicism, fire as the chief spiritual medium through which life's highest ideals were manifested. But this thrust of hormones also had an equal and opposite reaction, as Libran ideals were called upon to help balance the brashness of brawn. With an spirited emphasis on &quot;Might makes Right&quot;, the qualities of law and justice were increasingly called upon to help offset belligerence, arrogance, and aggressiveness. Of necessity, legal systems flourished as civilization developed codes of ethics to help contain these headstrong surges of testosterone. Throughout the Age of Aries, we find the law emerging as one of civilization's major milestones. History records the Code of Hammurabi, the Judaic Torah, and the Roman System of Justice as but a few examples evolving out of the civilizations of this period. This last tradition is the one from which our own legal system is derived, and we find Latin terms littered throughout the legal language of our courts even today.</P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;  But as heroism in the quest for the Golden Fleece evaporated, the ideals of Aristotle faded as the compassion of Christ took hold. The earlier philosophy, in typical Aries/Libra fashion, touted courage and justice as virtues towards which civilization was to aspire, while the new Messiah, in appropriate Piscean fashion, taught humility, surrender to the will of God, and a spiritual reward in a realm not of this world. Arian ascendancy produced the predominance of the male archetype, a fear of God, and the science of warfare. The Christian ethic looked instead to the poor, aged, and infirm. When an early Christian deacon was commanded by the Roman authorities to reveal the treasures of the newly formed church, they were taken to see the hungry and the sick. While the classical tradition espoused the virtues of royality and nobility, the disciples of Jesus turned their attention toward the spiritual needs of the common people; of the beggar and the thief. On the stage of life, the Divine Fire was being extinguished by the Baptismal Waters.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As Time closed the Book on one chapter, it opened another. The pillars of classical civilization collapsed, only to be reborn in the illegal, secret gatherings of the new faith. The wise men of the western world, from Etruscans, to rabbinical writers, to the Chaldeans, were aware that an epoch was about to unfold, and prophecies anticipated a new herald, a new prince, indeed, a new king to come show the way. In the Judaic tradition, many erroneously looked toward another warrior king to follow in the footsteps of David, but it was not to be. The Age of the Warrior King occupying the place of supremacy was at an end.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The test of time was to eventually prove these prophecies to be correct, as we have now borne witness to two thousand years of the teachings of Jesus as the dominant mold of western civilization.</P>                       <P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P> </CENTER><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="391" height="320">              <TR>                <TD>                         <IMG SRC="../../img/Jesus.cross.sm.JPG" ALT="Jesus Carrying the Cross" WIDTH="389" HEIGHT="318" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Bringing in the New Age<BR> with a new religious symbolism marked by the Cross</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>...as one age succeeds another</H4></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&quot;But the most striking phenomenon of all was when the sound of a trumpet rang out from a perfectly clear and cloudless sky with a shrill, prolonged, and dismal note so loud that people were driven half crazy with terror. The Etruscan wise men declared that this portent foretold a change over into a new age and a total revolution in the world... In each age the lives and manners of men are different and God has established for each age a definite span of time which is determined by the circuit of the Great Year. Whenever this circuit comes to an end and another begins some marvellous sign appears either on earth or in heaven so that it becomes at once clear to those who have made a thorough study of the subject that men of a different character and way of life have now come into the world and the gods will be either more or less concerned with this new race than they were with their predecessors. All sorts of changes occur, they say, as one age succeeds another and in particular with regard to the art of divination one can observe that there are times when it rises in prestige and its predictions are accurate because clear and unmistakable signs are sent from heaven; and then again in another age it is not held in much honor, since for the most part its practitioners are relying on mere guesswork and are trying to grasp the future with senses that have become blunt and dim. This, at all events, was the story told by the wisest men among the Etruscans who were thought to know more than most about such things.&quot</P><CENTER><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Plutarch's &quot;Fall of the Roman Republic&quot;</B></P></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
