As one Age gives way to another, the currents of consciousness are redirected and establish new channels. Faced with these changes, the pillars which hold up society crumble, and chaos and uncertainty follow in their wake. This process has unfolded twice before in recorded history, and we currently stand at the gates of another, watching yet one more 'end time' unfold.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="240" height="238">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/AthenaReads2T.gif" ALT="Studying the Bible" WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="236" BORDER="0"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Athena studying the Bible</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible speaks of the 'end of time', both in the Old and New Testaments; but different epochs are being portrayed. The New Testament speaks of the future in the Synoptic books and Revelation, with events many contend are not far away. Last week we examined the Old Testament, with its symbolic references to the four great beasts which would appear before the 'time of the end.' The events Daniel predicts look forward to what was then the future, but is now the distant past. This week, we will examine a second dream which dealt with this same period, leading us to believe that they were looking at their 'time of the end.' </P> <P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the references which obviously allude to some preordained period, marked by certain predictions which would unfold. In Daniel 8:19-22, the angel Gabriel interprets the second of Daniel's dreams, so we are made to understand.</P><P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come," he said, "I will tell you what is going to happen when the wrath comes to an end; this concerns the appointed End. As for the ram that you saw, its two horns are the kings of Media and of Persia. The hairy he-goat is the king of Javan, the large horn between its eyes is the first king. The horn that snapped and the four horns that sprouted in its place are four kingdoms rising from his nation but not having his power."</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The epoch is established by the angel. The vision outlines the immediate future for the Middle East. Daniel lives during the time of the Chaldeans. The two kingdoms which follow are those of the Medes and the Persians (the Ram with its two horns). The latter was overthrown by Alexander (the original horn of the goat), who died at the height of his power, with his conquests divided into Macedonian, Seleucid, and Ptolemaic kingdoms, together with the original Greek homelands, making four smaller horns, or kingdoms, in all.</P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Daniel, addressing an epoch before the birth of Christ, and the current 'end of time' as referred to by the New Testament, both be correct? Because they each refer to the end of different astrological Ages. The former marked the end of the classical Age (Aries), while the latter marks the end of our current epoch of civilization. </P><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"><BR><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="405" height="297">              <TR>                <TD>                                  <IMG SRC="../../img/Const.Ram.GIF" ALT="The Lamb of God" WIDTH="403" HEIGHT="295"> <P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Celestial Time Line during the Age of Aries</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><CENTER><H4>Carving Up the Lamb of God</H4></CENTER></P>            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the constellation Aries, several alignments of the vernal equinox are shown, with its ecliptic intersection (providing the RAM, or Right Ascension Midheaven) at various times in history. The Age of Aries opened with the patriarch, Abraham, variously dated between 2200-1800 BC by different traditions. The height of Mycenaean civilization (1500 BC) declined around 1200 BC, as Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt. The Chaldean Empire reached its peak with Nebuchadnezzar, from 604-561 BC, about the time the Book of Daniel was written (535 BC). After the conquests of Alexander, Daniel describes the 'Time of the End', around 165 BC, just as the Classical Age was coming to an end. </P><P><FONT FACE="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica" SIZE="2"><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=3><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
