The time of the exact full moon is 12:52 Monday morning, less than an hour after midnight Sunday. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="268" height="202">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/FullMoon.gif" ALT="Full Moon" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>           Seven hours later Saturn and Neptune align, at 7:45 a.m. Monday. Two other outer planetary alignments occur on Tuesday, with Jupiter opposing both Saturn and Neptune. On Wednesday, Mercury and Venus each make aspects to Saturn, Neptune, and Jupiter. The strongest of these combinations are the ones we've been looking at all year, exact on Monday the 13th; but its possible that we could be in the middle of contending with whatever it is at that time, with the Full Moon possibly triggering events over the week-end.</P> <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As we've mentioned all year, the basic Saturn-Neptune conjunction in Capricorn has been dealing with the restructuring of governmental systems everywhere. Japan, China, South Africa, all the east bloc countries, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and now even England may be in the picture unless Thatcher can reverse the recent drop in her popularity.  <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="268" height="202">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/SaturnNeptune.jpg" ALT="Saturn conjunct Neptune" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>This has been the general trend. The exact alignments of Saturn and Neptune seemed more to have focused on environmental events. Shortly after the first Saturn-Neptune combo this year (due to retrograde motion there are three), the Exxon Valdez spilled her oil. Exactly on the second alignment (within 12 hours), three oil spills combined to muddy our national waters in Rhode Island, Delaware and Texas. The third combination is the one that occurs next week. But there areother clues to the nature of the energy of these two outer planets. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the inner planets (those closer to the Sun, and therefore moving at a greater rate of speed) make aspects to this ol' one two, they trigger this larger theme at work. When the Sun and Mars (God of War and the military) squared Saturn and Neptune, the coup in Panama almost happened, leaving our own government looking like their shoelaces were tied together. When Mercury squared Saturn and Neptune, San Francisco quaked.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the final alignment of Saturn and Neptune represent shifts in the earth energies (Capricorn is an earth sign dealing with our practical realities) of a governmental level, or will it deal with some ecological oil spill or even a literal earth shift? We're on the countdown, and by the time the Advocate comes out next week, my bet is that we'll already know what it was.</P>     <BR><IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>               <CENTER><B>HINDSIGHT DEPARTMENT</P>   </CENTER>   <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="168" height="110">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/WhatHappened.jpg" ALT="What happened?"

Because the inner planets move faster, they tend to set off, or trigger these heavier, more ponderous and slower outer planetary combinations. It is for this same reason that we don't see outer planet alignments like this very often. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; {What was the media response to these predictions?
