Now is the time we've been looking at and talking about all year long, and this week the reality will come crashing home, shaking our foundations beneath us.</P> <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are talking about, of course, is the final alignment of Saturn and Neptune, occurring on the Full Moon at the start of this week. The theme has been building recently, with the resignations of the East German government only the last in a series of hierarchical shifts world-wide related to these celestial overtones. All of it has been but a preamble to what we must now be willing to deal with on the Earth.  To fully embrace the future, we must first be willing to let go of the past. But that means letting go of the securities and assurances that the past has had to offer, and moving instead towards a future that we can only dimly perceive. Remember the Harmonic Convergence a couple of years ago? It was dubbed the beginning of the &quot;acceleration&quot;.  <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="268" height="202">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/SaturnNeptune.jpg" ALT="Saturn conjunct Neptune" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>Look around you. World events are gaining momentum. The birth of a collective, world consciousness will be one of the eventual manifestations that will come from all that is now taking place, but the labor pains of this new birth must be felt before the child is to emerge. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, even in the face of world wide calamities, there are those in positions of power who would continue to impede its progress, reluctant to give up the status quo. &quot;Yet Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and as had been foretold, he would not listen. Still Moses entreated him, to 'let my people go'.&quot;</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Earth cries out for change, calling to be released from the scars of the past, and still &quot;Pharaoh&quot; has been reluctant to heed these calls. In the environmental arena in the Netherlands last week, better than 60 nations of the world recognized this need and coordinated their efforts to stabilize the emissions of the gases blamed for global warming by the year 2000, and yet their collective efforts were blocked by three nations; Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="268" height="202">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/FullMoon.gif" ALT="Full Moon" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>President Bush claimed that he was fighting an extremist position that could limit industrial development. Sixty nations of the world stand together on common ground in a coordinated effort and Bush, representing one of three nations, is fighting &quot;extremists&quot;? That's better than 20 to one. What is wrong with this picture?</P>  <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this point forward, the Earth will begin to take matters into her own hands. Think not that these represent &quot;random factors&quot; that &quot;coincidentally&quot; happen to be transpiring at this time. We would be amiss not to mention the fear and paranoia that will emerge from the outgrowth of what is now occurring, but it is a paranoia that stems from trying to live yesterday tomorrow. Those who adhere to the old ways will have the most to fear. Those who will work together, reaching out n new directions with new tools in a cooperative manner; they are the ones who will hold the seeds of the new dawn. A statement is now being made. Read it, and heed it well. Your future is at stake.</P><br>  <IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>               <CENTER><B>HINDSIGHT DEPARTMENT</P>   </CENTER>   <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="168" height="110">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/WhatHappened.jpg" ALT="What happened?"

Because the inner planets move faster, they tend to set off, or trigger these heavier, more ponderous and slower outer planetary combinations. It is for this same reason that we don't see outer planet alignments like this very often. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; {What was the media response to these predictions?
