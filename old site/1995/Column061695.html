Starting with the Vernal Equinox issue, we have taken the time to go into some detail on the predictions of the Book of Revelation. Now, one quarter turn of the solar wheel later, we will bring this series to a close. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of our series has been the slippage of the Vernal Equinox along the ecliptic, and the star groups that are to be found there. Because the Vernal Equinox has been moving through the constellation Pisces, this is what astrologers call the period of time known as the 'Age' of Pisces. As the Vernal Equinox moved over the stars of a smaller sub-set of this constellation, known to the Chinese as <I>Wae Ping,</I> or a rolled screen, this has represented the historical unfolding of the seven seals of Revelation. </P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="446" height="113">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/AlphaOmega.jpg" ALT="The Alpha and the Omega" WIDTH="444" HEIGHT="111" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Notice the gird markers spaced thirty degrees apart<BR>One-twelfth of a circle</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing with this logic, the start of the next sub-set of stars in the constellation would seem to mark the beginning of our next epoch of time. Coincidentally, the phrase "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end" takes on a curious ring when you consider that Alpha Pisces is the star that begins the first sub-set, and Omega Pisces begins the second. This is from a choice of approximately 24 principal stars in the constellation covering the entire Greek alphabet. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this movement in time along the ecliptic (the path of the Sun) is matched by a similar movement at the pole of heaven. While Polaris, the last star in the tail of the Little Bear marks the current center of heaven, almost five thousand years ago heaven's center was commanded by another star, Thuban or Alpha Draconis, the heart of the Dragon. The ancient Egyptians called this star 'the highest judge', because it sat motionless (compared to other stars and planets) in the sky. Over the course of these thousands of years, the pole has slowly shifted from the constellation of the Dragon into that of the Bear, and the highest pinnacle of power has passed from Dragon to Bear. This is how Revelation 13: 1-2 described it. </P>    </CENTER> <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="224" height="323">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/VikingDragonGoldHead.jpg" ALT="Viking Dragon" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="321" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The dragon had handed over...<BR>his own power and his throne<BR>and his world-wide authority</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I saw a beast emerge from the sea: it had seven heads and ten horns, with a coronet on each of its ten horns, and its heads were marked with blasphemous titles.
