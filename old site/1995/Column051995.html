Then all the earthly rulers, the governors and the commanders, the rich people and the men of influence, the whole population, slaves and citizens, took to the mountains to hide in caves and among the rocks. They said to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us away from the One who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb.

This battle inspired the Song of Roland, one of the greatest of the medieval epics. </P> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But more importantly, the end of the eighth century saw the beginning of the nadir of Christian civilization with the onset of the dark ages of medieval Europe.

Great numbers of the monasteries were completely destroyed- a serious blow to learning, since they were the chief centers of education. The fear these rapacious pirates inspired is echoed eloquently in the prayer, introduced into the litany, 'From the fury of the Northmen, good Lord, deliver us.'" </P>   </BLOCKQUOTE>		<BR>   <BLOCKQUOTE>   <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "About the middle of the ninth century, the activities of the Northmen entered a new phase.
