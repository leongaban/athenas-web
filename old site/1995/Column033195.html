All of Christianity was aware that there would be a time of the Master's return, when most people would be metaphorically sleeping, having forgotten their sacred relationship with the divine. If the code contained in this last book of the Bible could be broken, it would supply knowledge and information about what was to come. But like a sacred key, you must know which lock can be opened, and without the correct lock, the key itself stands as little more than an intricate ornament. But the lock was cleverly hidden where everyone had access to it, but few realized it. Revelation unlocks the vault of heaven and the treasures that lie hidden within.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The astronomical motion of the passage of the Vernal Equinox (VE) over the first seven stars of the cord of the southern fish in the constellation Pisces can be easily tabulated by anyone familiar with precessional motion. The date of the longitudinal conjunction of the VE with <I>Al Rescha,</I> the knot in the cord uniting the two fish and the first star in the constellation, is 392 BC. According to Livy in Book V, the Roman conquest of Veii marked the first time that troops were both paid by the state, and asked to endure the harsh conditions of a winter campaign. It marked the start of a new era.</P>    <BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tribunes were saying just now that pay ought not to have been granted to the soldiers, because it had never been granted before. How then can they now object if men who are better off than they used to be are asked to do more for it- to contribute additional service in proportion to their gain?"</P>   </BLOCKQUOTE>   <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after a long, exhausting struggle...</P> <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="224" height="412">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/Mars.gif" ALT="The God of War" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="410" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Conquest of Veii<BR>The beginning of Roman ascendancy</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such was the fall of Veii, the wealthiest city of Etruria. Even her final destruction witnessed to her greatness, for after a siege of ten summers and ten winters, during which she inflicted worse losses than she suffered, even when her destined hour had come she fell by a stratagem and not by direct assault."</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The translators of this Penguin Classics text state that the fall of Veii occurred in 392 BC, the same year that the first seal of the scroll was opened. This is what <I>A History of Rome,</I> by H. H. Scullard, Emeritus Professor of Ancient History, University of London had to say about this conflict:</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "This struggle, which marked the first definite step in Rome's career of world conquest, was remembered in Roman tradition as a turning point in the military history of the city, and the siege of Veii which ended it was magnified into a ten years' investment, a Roman counterpart to the Greek leaguer round Troy..."</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there, in fact, a correlation between the seals and history? Stay with us as we unravel the Web and watch the plot unfold. In more ways than one, the final answer may be a little over your head.</P>   <CENTER> <B><A href="Column040795.html"><B>Next week:</B></A>			 Pisces' Vertebra</P>   </CENTER><IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
