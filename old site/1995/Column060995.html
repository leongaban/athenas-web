Our supposition is that this work was created to represent a time line of future events, and that the 'predictions' have in fact come to pass in precisely the year in which they were called for.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole point of reviewing much of what may be perceived as ancient history has its corollary for both the present and future. While the Lamb has already opened the seven seals, we now stand at the threshold of the events that follow. </P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="444" height="111">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/AlphaOmega.jpg" ALT="Alpha and Omega" WIDTH="444" HEIGHT="111" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>In the Beginning- <BR>Alpha Piscium: 392 BC</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This reference to the Alpha and the Omega occurs only three times in the entire Bible, and all three are found in the Book of Revelation. The verse quoted above is Revelation 22:13. It is telling us of the time period marked by the beginning and end of the Age of Pisces, the epoch through which the principal events of the Book of Revelation were to take place. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="224" height="323">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/OmegaPiscium.jpg" ALT="Omega" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="206" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The Lamb's next task<BR>The opening of Omega</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>             They began as the Vernal Equinox (VE), aka zero degrees of the sign Aries, or the Ram in its infancy (the Lamb) aligned with and opened the principal stars of the constellation of the fish. The first star the VE conjuncted was Alpha Pisces, while the star now being approached is Omega Pisces. These two stars mark the beginning and the end of this Age, and yet both are part of the larger whole. </P> <BR>   <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon completion of Pisces, we will enter the Age of Aquarius. This is announced in Rev. 21:</P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared now, and there was no longer any sea..."</P>   </BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pisces is a water sign and rules the sea.</P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then the One sitting on the throne spoke: 'Now I am making the whole of creation new,' he said. 'Write this: that what I am saying is sure and will come true.' And then he said, 'It is already done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give water from the well of life free to anybody who is thirsty..."</P>   </BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Aquarius is stylized as a man who pours a stream from the urn. As a constellation, it rules freedom. But before the beginning of this new creation, astronomically set for 2013, much of the accumulated garbage of the previous centuries must be swept away. The seven seals have passed, but the seven trumpets, running from Revelation 8 to 21, have yet to be sounded, and there's not much time left. All of these events still lie in the future, and are beginning to unfold in the climatic and social changes that we see all around us. For those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, the time is fast approaching. If you're interested (and you should be), these books bear reading, for the Master is about to return.</P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "So stay awake, because you do not know the day when your master is coming. You may be quite sure of this that if the householder had known at what time of the night the burglar would come, he would have stayed awake and would not have allowed anyone to break through the wall of his house. Therefore, you too must stand ready because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -Matthew 24: 42-44 </P>   </BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to get your house in order.</P>   <CENTER> <B><A href="Column061695.html"><B>Next week:</B></A>				 The Last Word</P>   </CENTER><IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
