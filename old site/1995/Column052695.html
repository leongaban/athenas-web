The seven stars that we have been studying represent a portion of Pisces, specifically the first seven stars along the stream of water leading to the more southern of the two fish of this constellation. This collection of seven stars represents a group which was designated in China as <I>Wae Ping,</I> the Rolled Screen (referred to as 'a scroll rolling up' in Revelation 6:14). </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; After delta Piscium there is a gap in heaven until we reach the next star in the constellation. If we were to watch each of the stars in the 'scroll' cross the horizon and mark their timings, thirteen minutes would elapse between delta and epsilon, ten minutes between epsilon and zeta, etc.    <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="CENTER" width="446" height="113">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/AlphaOmega.jpg" ALT="Wae Ping, the Rolled Screen" WIDTH="444" HEIGHT="111" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Wae Ping, the Rolled Screen<BR>including alpha, xi, mu, nu, zeta, epsilon and delta Piscium</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>The remaining stars would take thirteen, thirteen, nineteen, and nine minutes respectively to rise. But between delta (the seventh seal) and omega, the next star in our series, there is a gap of 48 minutes.  The opening of the seventh seal calls for a 'silence in heaven for about half an hour'. Understand that those in antiquity did not use the standardized time notations that we do today, and a half hour varied from 20 to 37 minutes in length throughout the year. Thus the designation, 'about a half hour' (48 minutes compared to 37) indicates the lack of celestial activity (stars) along the constellation as marked by the Vernal Equinox. The name astrology etymologically translates as logos, the 'word' of the astrum, 'star' or stars. Astrology is the language of the stars. The lack of stellar activity along the Vernal Equinox simply indicates that for about a half an hour, heaven was not speaking to us, or there was a 'silence in heaven'. </P>   <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="224" height="169">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/Jupiter.jpg" ALT="Jupiter, Chief God of the Romans" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="167" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Jupiter<BR>chief god of the Romans</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far in our examination, the opening of the seven seals have generally indicated a period of disintegration and social chaos in the development of Roman history. Rome has represented the terrestrial axis around which our civilization has turned for over the last two thousand years. It is the social mortar that has bonded us together, first through the establishment of the Republic and Empire, and then through the power of Christianity and the Church. Was there anything of significance that occurred in 1054 which seems to fit this theme? </P>    <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="63" height="104">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/PopeLeoIX" ALT="Pope Leo IX" WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="102" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Pope Leo IX</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Schism of 1054 is marked as the year of the final cleavage between the Eastern and Western Churches which had continued to unite the old Roman Empire. Although politically and militarily divided for many centuries, the Greek notion of <I>oikowmene,</I> of one universal Christian society, had persevered, although weathered, until this time. But differences in philosophy, language, and culture contributed toward the tendency to drift apart, and when Rome insisted on Constantinople's compliance and obedience, the rift became final as each side excommunicated the other for what they perceived as outrageous acts. </P>  <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the opening of the first seal marked the start of Rome's ascendancy, so the seventh seal marked the final cleavage of the church.</P>   <CENTER> <B><A href="Column060295.html"><B>Next week:</B></A>			 The Coming of Omega</P>   </CENTER><IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
