Long has it been since sweet songs reverberated through these halls. The incense which curled around the columns reaching high overhead now lie in a pile of ash on the floor. Even so, the dust of time has not settled here, for the splendor of this dwelling is as great as it ever was. This tabernacle is waiting in reverent silence for the Master's return.  </P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="333" height="187">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/AlphaPiscium.jpg" ALT="The Beginning- Alpha" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="187" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>In the Beginning- <BR>Alpha Piscium: 392 BC</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is from this holy shrine that creation stands in judgment over the Earth. The Sun in an annual pilgrimage will illuminate with his great torch the secret site, showing where the Lamb of God is about to be sacrificed on the altar of time.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The vernal equinox (VE) is often referred to by astronomers as zero degrees of Aries. This imaginary crossing of two slowly changing celestial lines marks the seasonal ingress to the first day of spring; when the path of the Sun (the ecliptic) crosses the extended girth of the Earth's full-bellied equator; proving that indeed, 'X' does mark the spot.</P> <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Zero degrees of Aries has long been one of the designations for this alignment, with the Ram representing the leader of the heavenly parade. But since it is the beginning of Aries that marks the equinox, it follows that it could be the Lamb (the Ram in its youth), which offers itself to God to be born, live, and die before giving way to the rotation of yet another annual sacrifice on the altar. </P>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Long ago, priests were careful to note which stars were moving into alignment with the VE, for this was not only the sighting stick by which time was measured, but also the single most powerful celestial catalyst known. Its position greatly magnified the inherent character of any star it came into contact with, or so the astrologer/priests believed. But for two reasons, this tradition was discontinued. First, the astrologer/priests were killed, interrupting the stream of information which flowed from one generation to the next. Second, for almost one thousand years, there has been no star in the constellation Pisces (the current epoch), over which the VE has passed.  Not since 1054 AD when the papal chair sat vacant for a full year, and Delta Piscium marked the final cleavage between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church, has the VE conjuncted a star in this constellation.</P> <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="335" height="206">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/DeltaPiscium.jpg" ALT="Delta Piscium" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="204" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>The last of the Seals<BR>Delta Piscium: 1054 AD</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Bible, at the end of a long mythological tradition, these stars were viewed as seals, which when triggered, would be opened, one by one. As zero degrees of Aries passed along the Scroll, the Chinese asterum marking the first half of the constellation Pisces, an angel of heaven wonders:</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything worthy to open the scroll and break the seals of it?"... </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lamb came forward to take the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne, and...</P><B>those in heaven chanted a new hymn:"You are worthy to take the scrolland break the seals of it, because you were sacrificed, and with your bloodyou bought men for Godof every race, language, people and nationand made them a line of kings and priests,to serve our God and to rule the world."&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -Revelation, Chapter 5</P>   <CENTER> <B><A href="Column032495.html"><B>Next week:</B></A>				 The Seals Broken</P>   </CENTER><IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
