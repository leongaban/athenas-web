The Romans themselves considered the fall of Veii as a turning point in the military history of the city. Revelation tells us that when this seal was broken, </P>   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>"...a white horse appeared, and the rider was holding a bow; he was given the victor's crown and he went away, to go from victory to victory."</P>   </BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="335" height="189">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/AlphaPiscium.jpg" ALT="The Beginning- Alpha" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="187" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>In the Beginning- <BR>Alpha Piscium: 392 BC</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to understand that these seals, or the stars they represent, are not limited simply to the years under which they occur, but represent the period following their opening as well. For example, Spring is not confined by the date of its entry into Aries, but represents the entire season which follows.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; What we deduce from heaven's history lesson is that the beginning of the Age of Pisces, which is marked by the Vernal Equinox aligning with the first star in this constellation grouping, commences in 392 BC. The framework for the entire age, from then until now, is being laid. Rome begins her ascendancy, bringing first one city and then another in Italy into her fold, establishes the Republic, and later the Empire, which in turn becomes the vehicle through which the Church finally assumes the reins of power and provides the social mortar of western civilization for the past two thousand years. Think of it as, "In the beginning..."</P>    </CENTER> <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="391" height="320">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Jesus.cross.sm.JPG" ALT="Christian Cross" WIDTH="389" HEIGHT="318" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>A new sign under heaven</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But to better understand the skeletal framework around which the fish wraps itself, it's important to gain some perspective on what Pisces energy really is, and how it's been viewed historically. Pisces, both the sign and constellation, along with its ruler Neptune, deals with the powers of the subconscious. It represents the realm that lies below the surface of the wine-dark sea, an area which most of us have very little first-hand experience with. The subconscious implies just that: below the level of consciousness. Therefore it is what we are not aware of or have forgotten. It is ignorance and blindness; denial and isolation. It is people who are absent, lost, or disappear in a variety of manners, all of which appear to be very mysterious. At the start of this era, Christ died on the cross not so much because he absorbed all of our sins and died for us, but rather that he became the archetype for the good man who experienced the suffering and loss that the world was about to be plunged into. Naturally, like all of heaven's plans, there is a rhyme and a reason to all of this, as well as a way to deal with it, but for now, let's continue. </P>   <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the opening of the first seal, Rome was to drink from this bitter cup of loss, as its next principal engagement, some six years after the conquest of Veii, was to be in turn sacked by a Gallic invasion, with all but the innermost citadel being violated and overrun by these foreign invaders. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, having laid out some of the skeletal structure of Pisces, let's look at the next seal.</P>   <BLOCKQUOTE>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "When he broke the second seal, I heard the second animal shout, 'Come.' And out came another horse, bright red, and its rider was given this duty: to take away peace from the earth and set people killing each other. He was given a huge sword." &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  -Revelation, Chapter 6: 3-4</P>   </BLOCKQUOTE>         <CENTER> <B><A href="Column041495.html"><B>Next week:</B></A>			 The Second Seal</P>   </CENTER><IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
