This tradition was not only familiar to those that studied the wisdoms of antiquity, but was also used extensively in this last, most mythic book of the entire Bible. </P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; For practical reasons, agricultural societies for thousands of years invested a great deal of stock in knowing how to ascertain the first day of spring. For this reason, the careful observation of when night and day stood in equal balance, as well as the position of the Sun and stars, were carefully noted. Over the passage of time, it was observed that the motion of the Vernal Equinox (VE) seemed to slowly drift 'backwards' through the constellations; and it had always been thought that each of these stellar groupings had their own distinct character or personality. Therefore, as the VE crossed out of one constellation and into another, it was believed that civilization changed its basic nature and viewed life and 'the gods' differently.</P>   <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="224" height="277">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Revelation/JohnatPatmos.jpg" ALT="John at Patmos" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="275" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Revelation was written by John<BR>on the island of Patmos</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Book of Revelation stands as a map of heaven observing what the writers believed was about to unfold, calling it at one point a new 'hymn'.</P>    <BLOCKQUOTE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, in my vision, I saw a door open in heaven and heard the same voice speaking to me, the voice like a trumpet, saying, 'Come up here: I will show you what is to come in the future.'" &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -Revelation 4:1</P>   </BLOCKQUOTE>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Book 4 then goes on to paint a picture of the heavens, complete with twenty-four elders (the twenty-four hours in the day), the seven flaming lamps burning, the seven Spirits of God (the seven visible planets), and even a lion, bull, human, and flying eagle (the four fixed signs of the zodiac: Leo, Taurus, Aquarius, and Scorpio) all positioned around the throne of God (heaven).</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having established our framework, we learn that only the Lamb of God (VE, <A href="Column031795.html"><B>see last week</B></A>) is capable of taking the Scroll from the right hand of God and breaking its seals.

Having ascertained the date, we can then determine if the Biblical breaking of the seals can be correlated to a specific historical moment in time. The scroll is held in the right hand of God, because at the beginning of the VE's passage through Pisces, the remaining stars all line up to the right of the Vernal Equinox as viewed from the Earth.</P>	<BR><BR><BR>   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>"Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four animals shout in a voice like thunder, 'Come.'
