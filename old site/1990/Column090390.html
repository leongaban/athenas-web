In a nut shell this should indicate some hard financial decisions being made by the administration. This doesn't mean that its going to be hard for the administration, but rather that it will be financially hard for the country. Fortunately, this country is old enough that we can go back in history and compliment our celestial design with past experience. Just what did happen the last time the US Midheaven squared the natal and progressed Pluto 180 years ago?</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically the analysis is simple. In 1810 the US was caught between a rock and a hard place. The internal situation was such that it left little room for maneuvering. This was the time of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, with Britain controlling the seas and France controlling the continent. On March 23rd, 1810, Napoleon signed his Rambouillet Decree ordering the seizure of all US ships in French ports. Over 10,000,000 in US shipping was seized. Relations between the US and Britain were strained because of the policy of the British navy to seize any seaman for service suspected of being English.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="224" height="222">              <TR>                <TD>                                      <CENTER>	<FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT>					</CENTER>                                <IMG SRC="../img/GeorgeIIINapoleon.jpg" ALT="George III examining Napoleon" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>King George III<BR> examines an undersized Napoleon</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only problem were that <U>all</U> Americans were suspected of being English. Between 1806 and leading up to the war of 1812, America passed various forms of the Embargo and Non-Intercourse Acts which, in its various stages, cut off trade with the world, shut off trade with Britain and France, and finally shut off trade with Britain. The outcome was to effectively damage US commerce (hitting New England the hardest), and encourage secessionist sentiment. At the time, these acts were called, &quot;the cure that killed.</P>  <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; How might administration policy now parallel historical events? With the S&amp;L bailouts on the horizon, and the pentagon having just doubled their estimate of the cost required to field a sizable US force in the Middle East, maybe we can indeed learn something from the lessons of history. Will New England again be hit the hardest? Well, the projected S&amp;L bailout will cost our region of the country more than any other, and the dependency of New England on oil is greater than that of any other region.</P>            <IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
