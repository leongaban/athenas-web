We left off last week at Iraq's Mercury-Uranus conjunction in the first house, which basically dealt with the degree of modernization they have gone through since their &quot;birth&quot; in 1958. Even in the last ten years under the weight of war, this process has continued at an amazing rate. While their military system was vastly superior to Iran's in 1980, the unexpected turn of events and the multitudes which they had to face forced them to develop a far more efficient strategy than they started with.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="335" height="335">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/IraqChart.jpg" ALT="The natal chart of Iraq" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="333" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>            <B>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the mid-80's, under the weight of massive suicidal frontal attacks, their armor and infantry developed mobile defense strategies, while their scientists obtained and modified used Soviet missiles and developed their chemical warfare capacities. Unlike many other Arabic countries, Iraq relies almost exclusively on their own engineers for the development and exportation for their oil reserves. This, of course, combines with their personal sense of nationalism and self-fulfillment.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Mercury-Uranus conjunction (think of it as a modern mind) is a part of a larger configuration in Iraq's map. It both trines their Midheaven and Saturn (and is therefore part of a grand trine), indicating that while they are forced by necessity to develop many of these &quot;alternatives&quot;. The end product is one of advantage and advancement. Another manifestation of this Mercury-Uranus combination is their governments use of the media (communication/technology). Trining both Saturn and the Midheaven, it well serves the governments needs, conveying their particular point of view on any given situation.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="147" height="179">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Bush/georgebushII.jpg" ALT="The President playing golf" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="177" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I can't imagine that anyone in the Bush administration would seriously consider that a personal message to the Iraqi people, relayed through overdubbing and subscripts, would do anything else but inflame the Iraqi's against us. If Hussein made a personal, televised appeal to you that was translated and subscripted (with or without hostages), how many of your family members would be won over?</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Iraq's fourth house (the position dealing with Iraq's land or home), we find Jupiter and the North Node in Libra, and Neptune in Scorpio. Together in a loose, running conjunction, these three positions indicate Iraq's abundance of natural resources in oil and the great wealth that is available here. Unfortunately, since Jupiter is involved in hard aspects to both Mars and the Sun (see last week) an overly aggressive governmental policy tends to get in the way of the full exploitation of this potential.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="168" height="110">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/WhatHappened.jpg" ALT="What happened?"

The short term implications of these developments look horrendous, but the long term potential can present the opportunity, once and for all, to examine our use of fossil fuels and finally do something about it rather than attempting to recapture and preserve the past in cheap oil.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; What d'ya think?</B></P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; {What was the media response to these predictions?
