In early September she successfully flagged Sept. 22nd and Nov. 8th as flash points in this dangerous chess match: and true to her word, first Hussein and then Bush declared on each of these days that if necessary, they would take the offensive. Although Athena finds both of their attitudes offensive, it might be appropriate to see if there are additional hot spots on the horizon.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Iraq's map, there are two formidable Martial aspects coming up, both of which will signal a significant rise in tension or action. On March 6th, Iraq's progressed Sun will parallel Mars, while on the 29th, the Moon's South Node will conjunct Mars. The former will be more brazen and obvious, with its results easier to predict. Confrontation is the natural flow of this combination, with anger and aggression riding to a peak. Whether or not open conflict results, tempers will flair. On the 29th, Iraq's being out of step with world opinion will reach a trough. Nadir City. This could be anything from ultimate loss to a blow below the belt. Shortly thereafter on the 10th of April, Iraq's progressed MC will parallel Mercury, and an official public pronouncement will ensue.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="52" height="79">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/GWPhotos/sadam.gif" ALT="Saddam Hussein" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="77" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Saddam</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the events outlined so far, it is the first that is most critical. But in typical Martial fashion, there are two celestial events that could set these events off early. On the 20th and 21st of February, Pluto will pivot, reversing and triggering economic and social slides. Then on the 23rd, Iraq's progressed Moon will parallel Mars, signaling a swelling up of public sentiment, anger, and opinion. If Athena doesn't miss her guess, each will represent part of the drama.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="142" height="112">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/GWPhotos/SaddamHusseinRobe.jpg" ALT="Saddam Hussein" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="110" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Saddam Hussein</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we can compare events in Iraq's chart to those on the U.S. map. Here we find two notable aspects. The first, Mars contraparalleling Neptune on Feb. 4th can represent smoke screens, disillusionment or deception. It's not what we could have wanted. More importantly on Feb. 26th is the single most powerful aspect that I have seen while writing the Web as the U.S. Midheaven in Aries squares our natal Pluto in Capricorn. This aspect deals with both economic hardship and the possibility of an executive pushing where we should not go.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="168" height="110">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/WhatHappened.jpg" ALT="What happened?"

Whether they spontaneously burst into flames remains under the control of those at the helm. Asked to pin it down, events from the Pluto pivot in late February to Iraq's Solar parallel to Mars on March 6th will be when cries for war may incite rash action, while prayers for peace will be most useful.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; {What was the media response to these predictions?
