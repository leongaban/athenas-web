Now that things have simmered a bit, we can get back to what we were doing.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; For some weeks, we 'have been promising to mention just when some of the economic turns were going to be hitting their nadir, and they are here. On February 26th, 1991, the progressed MC will square natal Pluto, and on March 31st, 1992, the progressed MC will square the progressed natal Pluto. Since its been so long, we'll quickly recap what happened the last time in history this aspect occurred.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. was economically sandwiched between Britain on the seas and France on the continent in 1810. The administration passed legislation that was disastrous to the U.S. economy, and to New England in particular. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="224" height="222">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/GeorgeIIINapoleon.jpg" ALT="George III and Napoleon" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>George III and Napoleon</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>Called &quot;the cure that killed,&quot; we were trying to impress the world with how economically important we were, and our fearless leader decided to halt trade so that &quot;we'd show them.&quot; Eventually this set of conditions led to the War of 1812 and the nation that really got hurt was our own. Although the timing of various forms of legislation corresponded with the celestial cues in the past, the tide of conditions surrounding them began to swell as early as 1806 and lasted 'til well after the war's end in 1814. The most basic interpretation of this aspect is financial reversal. Expanding on that, we have administrative legislation leading to financial reversal.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which brings us to the present. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="52" height="79">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/GWPhotos/sadam.gif" ALT="Saddam Hussein" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="77" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Saddam</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>Right now the U.S. is leading a U.N.-sanctioned embargo to effectively attempt to strangle Saddam Hussein, who, on the other hand, seems to have single-handedly surrounded the world trade markets. And so now we play a waiting game, but there is one thing about this upcoming crisis that concerns me, and that's the first of these two aspects, in February, 1991, which occurs while the progressed U.S. Moon is Void of Course. What I have seen in the past is that real mayhem can strike under these conditions, as the normal set of precautions do not seem to be in affect. Folks are caught off guard or fumble the ball through a lack of attention. Since we are looking at the economic arena here, it would seem that this is where it's going to happen.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="168" height="110">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/WhatHappened.jpg" ALT="What happened?"

Some of the basic circumstances we're dealing with, and the strongest aspects that are upcoming for the next two years in the U.S. chart. We could be looking at the accumulation and snowballing of the S&amp;L crisis, the cost of funding troops overseas (to maintain cheap oil??), plus the events in the game plan which aren't even apparent yet, like possible additional bank failures. However these conditions manifest themselves, it will require that the U.S. take a good hard look at its fiscal responsibilities and obligations. At this stage of the game, that may not be prophecy for anyone, but the events reaching their peak and the timing of it will be.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; {What was the media response to these predictions?
