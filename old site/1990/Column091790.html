The national character, fiber, and personality of every country is different, and the events shaping their &quot;birth&quot; lend themselves strongly towards forming the national psyche.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 14th of July, 1958, Iraq became an independent republic, severing themselves once and for all from monarchy. Baghdad radio reported that this event took place at 5:30 in the morning. This combination of both time and space formed a nation with both a Cancerian Sun and Ascendant, the Sun having just risen over the desert horizon. Cancerian energy produces an emotional sentiment unmoved by logic. This water sign <U>feels</U> their way through life, swayed by the currents that ebb and flow around them. &quot;My country right or wrong,&quot; or, &quot;Love it or leave it,&quot; are typical Cancerian sentiments.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancer is often associated with Mom, and even though she may have faults, there is a bond there that transcends both logic and ideological boundaries. She gave birth, nourished, and protected you, helping to shape your view on life since the day you were born. That cuts a lot of mustard. Born on the 4th of July, this country is also a Cancerian nation, and the identification with the flag waving, apple-pie laced nationalism is as strong here as there. The geography of our nation, falling as it does between two oceans, has helped shape our destiny more than many people realize. In Iraq this geographical identification comes as the land of two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, and their currents have represented the lifeblood of this arid country.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="335" height="333">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/IraqChart.jpg" ALT="The natal chart of Iraq" WIDTH="333" HEIGHT="333" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3></H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Iraq's Sun falls just above the horizon they are strongly motivated by unconscious promptings from the past. The ghost of Nebuchadnezzar and the conquests and glory of Babylon looms largely in a collective psyche seeking to regain a measure of their ancient stature. Saddam Hussein has fostered this identification, claiming that he is, in fact, the reincarnation of this Biblical king. If we look more closely at their national map, we see Mars in Aries in the tenth house, indicating a strong and militaristic leader that, on the one hand is dynamic and courageous,but on the other is crude, arrogant and belligerent, forcing his will on others when he can't get his way.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars in the 10th is squaring the Sun on the Ascendant, emphasizing that latter part of this interaction. These two planets of command and authority are working against each other in a frictional manner, and they are currently manifesting themselves in the personality of Saddam Hussein. Add to this Mercury and Uranus in Leo in the first, and you can have a brilliant intellect that works towards modernization and independence, once again combined with a ego that won't quit.</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="168" height="110">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/WhatHappened.jpg" ALT="What happened?"
