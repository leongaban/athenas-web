This was the war that resulted the last time in American history that the U.S. Midheaven squared our natal Pluto. Caught in the throws of a difficult financial situation, the U.S. Administration under Jefferson tried to show how important we were, and sought to place an economic embargo on the world by refusing to trade with anyone. Under the Non-Intercourse Act, this was later modified to simply not trading with England or France, the primary cause of our dissatisfaction. But as it turned out, the remedy was more harmful than the disease. &quot;As John Randolph remarked in a typical sally, the administration was trying &quot;to cure the corns by cutting off the toes.&quot; Hailed as the &quot;cure that killed,&quot; the Embargo Act had catastrophic effects.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference between the last U.S. Midheaven square to Pluto and this upcoming one on Feb. 26th, 1991, is that the last time the U.S. Midheaven was in Libra, and our refusal to trade was an attempt to find a peaceful path between two powerful belligerents. <TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="LEFT" width="401" height="184">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/BattleoftheNile.jpg" ALT="Battle of the Nile" WIDTH="399" HEIGHT="182" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>Britain and France wrestle for control of the seas</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE>Being caught between a rock and a hard place (France had seized over 200 U.S. ships, while Britain had seized over 500), there seemed to be little room to maneuver politically. Like last time, we now find ourselves in a situation which threatens our financial security through our dependence on oil. After all, we might have to buy it from Hussein! This time, the U.S. Midheaven in Aries, <I>we</I> are one of the belligerents. Aries is ruled by Mars, the God of War, and the tendency is to be impetuous, belligerent, or to rush to war over financial issues (squaring Pluto), is a typical manifestation. The celestial council advises that forced short term solutions are likely to be disastrous and costly.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Surely the embargo was a mistake. The U.S. ought either to have suffered the indignities heaped upon its vessels for the sake of profits...Jefferson...instead...applied harsher and harsher regulations in a futile effort to accomplish his purpose.&quot;</P><TABLE border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="10" align="RIGHT" width="142" height="142">              <TR>                <TD>                      <IMG SRC="../img/Bush/georgebushI.jpg" ALT="George Bush, 41st president" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="140" BORDER="0"><P>                                <CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660099"><H3>President Bush</H3></FONT></CENTER>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In <A href="../1990/Column091090.html"> <B>early September</B></A>, <I>Athena's Web</I> pointed to several upcoming dates for the Mideast crisis. All the dates so far have indeed been critical to this conflicts' development. On the last one, <A href="../1990/NYT110990.html"> <B>Nov. 8th</B></A>, we said that the wheels of war had started to turn. On that date, Bush announced his intention to practically double his troop quota so that we might take the offensive. At the same time, we also spoke of the end of February, 1991, as being a time of concern.</P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, the remedy is proving to be more harmful than the disease; which brings to mind another maxim. &quot;It is a wise man who rules the stars, and a fool who is ruled by them.&quot; Currently this nation is following the path of being ruled by their stars. Our administration is manifesting one of the most least desirable interpretations of this heavenly trail.</P>            <IMG SRC="../img/greekbanner2.GIF" ALT="divider" WIDTH="547" HEIGHT="15"></P>                  </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE><P><B><HR>                  <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Translate         to: </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_fr&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Fran&ccedil;ais</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_de&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Deutsch</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_it&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Italiano</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_pt&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Portugu&ecirc;s</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         | </FONT><A HREF="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?doit=done&lp=en_es&urltext=http://www.athenasweb.com/column.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">Espa&ntilde;ol</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Geneva,sans-serif">         </FONT>                  <HR><P><p><a href="#top"><img src="../img/top.gif" width="50" height=     "23" align="RIGHT" alt="to top of page" border="0"></a></p>    <B>If you're on a <BIG>Mac</BIG>,&nbsp; and you're NOT using <BIG>Netscape</BIG>,&nbsp;<BR>you're missing the special font,&nbsp; by way of <A HREF="http://www.&nbsp;truedoc.&nbsp;com">TrueDoc Dynamic Fonts</A>,&nbsp;as seen in this CLIP:<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../img/getNetscape.jpg" ALT="image showing TrueDoc font" WIDTH="496" HEIGHT="38" BORDER="1"><BR><BR></P>So if you like the font, and you've got the time, <BIG>download</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html"><IMG SRC="../img/netscape.now_butt.gif" ALT="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A>                                   </TD>              </TR>            </TABLE></B></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
