                            <h2>About Athena's Web</h2>
                            <p>Athena's Web received its official birth on Dec 1, 1978 as an hour long radio program on WMUA, Amherst, MA. Airtime was 6 PM, sharp . It continued in this guise for five years, and evolved to include spot forecasts given twice daily during the week on the celestial currents. On this series we talked to astronomers, astrologers, professors, and priests about their observations of astrology; of where it fit in the church, in history, in science and amongst other astrologers and the public.</p>

                            <p>In our Music of the Spheres' segment, we explored the celestial nature of various artists through their craft. Entire shows were devoted to Hendrix, Morrison, and Joplin, but also to Billie Holiday, Judy Collins and Donovan, among others. In '83, a column entitled Athena's Web was begun in the Campus Connection, and was picked up by the Advocate Newspapers a year later, with a circulation of over a quarter million in the Connecticut River Valley of New England. Currently, the Web is being carried in the Connecticut River Valley of New England, and the five college area through the Amherst Bulletin.</p>

                            <p>In '86, Athena's Web was aired as a segment of Cable Connection,a PM Magazine television show out of Springfield, MA and featured the daily spot forecasts for a year. Don went on to write, produce, and edit four half hour shows on Astrology 101 through the an introduction to the twelve signs of the zodiac in a series entitled Springfield by Starlight.</p>
